<p>When you start a family, food habits change. You may eat out less and start cooking from scratch, or even cook from scratch less and eating more frozen dinners or take out. &nbsp;It is a time consuming job to fill the mouth of a toddler! My goal since becoming a mother has been to feed my family healthy meals and to not become a short order cook. I hear many families who make different meals for each child and then one for the parents. This can be expensive and time consuming as you are shopping for, preparing, and cleaning up after multiple dinner for one evening.</p>
<p>My goal is to provide you with a series that instructs you how to cook a recipe, something basic like chicken stock or a more elegant meal, in a way that you can feed it to a baby eating purees, a toddler eating finger foods, picky children, and still feel like as an adult you are choosing the meal. After a few posts you should be able to look at the meals that are already staples in your household and figure out how to prepare them for a whole family eating at different stages.</p>
<p>I also will provide tips on how to get your kids in the kitchen. &nbsp;Having your kids cook helps them take pride in the food they make, which will make them more likely to eat foods they otherwise may not try. &nbsp;It also helps teach them about nutrition and hopefully when they finally leave for college they wont come home 20 pounds heavier. &nbsp;At times it may take longer to make your meal, but your kids will be occupied and not begging for you to get an out of reach toy.</p>
<p>The following recipes should be helpful to those who already know how to cook and need to adjust it for a new family, for those who want to condense the meals they make for their family, and even those without a family who just want to learn to cook.</p>
