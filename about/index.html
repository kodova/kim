  content: "Hi, Kim!\r\n\r\nI missed out on the F&amp;F event last night, but came
    to check out this site as a result of your post. I'm wondering if you have any
    suggestions for salad dressings when on the Daniel Fast? I'm preparing better
    this time, and that is what I struggle with most while doing the fast.\r\n\r\nThanks
    in advance for any help you might be able to offer...\r\n\r\nHugs, Liz"

  content: 'Congratulations for choosing to live healthier!  For the Daniel Fast program,
    it looks like the biggest thing you need to look for in salad dressing recipes
    is the lack of an added sweetener. Do you have a bottled dressing you like? I
    could maybe help you recreate it to fit your program.  My <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;chili-lime-vinaigrette&#47;"

<p>The name "Kitchen Instruction Manual" was created from my husband&rsquo;s clever and creative thinking. &nbsp;He loves to make up new words by combining two existing words or finding clever acronyms for words (which sometimes leads to changing the meaning of that word in our household). &nbsp;Randomly, he came up to me with a big smile and said &ldquo;You are my Kitchen Instruction Manual.... get it?&rdquo; After getting beyond the meaning of each individual word I realized that he found a new acronym - this time for my name, KIM! &nbsp;And it fits perfectly.</p>
<p>The idea for this blog is that I will be the "manual" you go to when in the kitchen. &nbsp;I have no desire to be focused on one thing in the kitchen like you often see in blogs. &nbsp;I love to cook, BBQ, bake, mix cocktails, pair wine &amp; beer with food, and even try some molecular gastronomy&#47;modernist cooking techniques.<br />
My goal with this blog is not to show off amazing culinary techniques that I learned from generations of family cooks or in a professional school - because I am completely self taught, with the help of blogs, magazines, and cookbooks. &nbsp;Instead, my goal is to help you learn how to cook, or how to improve your cooking and tasting skills. &nbsp;Sometimes this will be through my own learning, showing you successful experiments as well as failures. &nbsp;To help you understand food, I will often discuss a particular ingredient or recipe by telling it&rsquo;s history or method of preparation. &nbsp;In addition to recipes there will also be articles on techniques, reviews on different appliances&#47;gadgets, and tips on menu planning and budgeting (as groceries get expensive!).</p>
<p>You will also see some posts on healthy eating habits, nutrition, and food from the perspective of an athlete. &nbsp;Those will be from Kristen, my twin sister! I am inspired by her quest to be healthy and hopefully you will be to.</p>
<p>With so many recipes in existence and being an at home untrained cook, it is rare to have something that is truly unique without a lot of time, work, and ingredient resources. &nbsp;I will try to credit where the recipe comes from both for respect of the cook and your reference even if I have adapted it beyond the "3 changes and it is original" rule. &nbsp;I read a lot of <a title="Magazines" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;magazines&#47;">magazines<&#47;a>,&nbsp;cookbooks, and blogs for inspiration. &nbsp;However, rarely do I make the recipe exactly as it is printed unless it is something very specific such as a baked good or a recipe from <a title="Get Modernist Cuisine at Home from Amazon.com" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;0982761015&#47;ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0982761015&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20" target="_blank">Modernist Cuisine at Home<&#47;a>&nbsp;or <a title="Get Alinea from Amazon.com" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;1580089283&#47;ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1580089283&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20" target="_blank">Alinea<&#47;a>. &nbsp;I would expect &nbsp;you to do the same with my recipes. &nbsp;Work with them to match your taste and palate.</p>
<p>I will try to regularly include information about equipment and ingredients and where to get them from. &nbsp;I have found that Amazon offers a lot of good products and will often link to them. &nbsp;I will be honest that those links are affiliate links. &nbsp;The money I receive from that goes into my cooking budget, to buy specialty ingredients or spend time perfecting a difficult original recipe. &nbsp;In addition to the links, I have created a store where I will try to put all of the products I purchase or recommend in one convenient <a title="Click here for my Amazon store!" href="http:&#47;&#47;astore.amazon.com&#47;kitchinstrman-20" target="_blank">location<&#47;a>.</p>
