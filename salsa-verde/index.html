<p>Salsa Verde means "Green Sauce" in both Italian and Spanish. &nbsp;However, they are two very different sauces.</p>
<h2>What is Italian Salsa Verde?<&#47;h2><br />
In Italian cuisine Salsa Verde is a cold (or room temperature) oil and vinegar mixture loaded with fresh herbs such as parsley, basil, mint, or tarragon. &nbsp;In addition it frequently is flavored with crushed garlic, anchovy or capers. &nbsp;All the ingredients can either be chopped and mixed together or tossed into a food processor and blended together. &nbsp;It can be served over cold,&nbsp;grilled, pan-seared or roasted meats, fish,&nbsp;salads,&nbsp;vegetables,&nbsp;or hard-boiled eggs.</p>

<h2>What is Mexican Salsa Verde?<&#47;h2><br />
In Mexican Cuisine Salsa Verde is similar to the typical red salsa in its use as a dip for tortilla chips or served with tacos and grilled pork or beef. &nbsp;The big differences is that it is more mild and it is green rather than red. The green base comes from green tomatoes known as tomatillos,&nbsp;jalape&ntilde;os, and cilantro.</p>
