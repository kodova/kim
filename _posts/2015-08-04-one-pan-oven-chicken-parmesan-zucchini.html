<p>You may be thinking "another breaded chicken recipe, does she cook anything else?".&nbsp; Of course! I cook new things every week. &nbsp;In fact, rarely do I repeat recipes unless I don't have time to <a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">menu plan<&#47;a>, I am doing a <a title="KIM&rsquo;s Pantry Clean Out" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;kims-pantry-clean-out&#47;">pantry clean out<&#47;a>&nbsp;(which I now do every other month),&nbsp;or my kids are sick. &nbsp;However, I don't share recipes the first time I make it. &nbsp;I typically want to make sure it is replicable and I want to put my own spin on it which takes time. &nbsp;Not to mention most evenings I cook a meal I'd like to share with you, life happens and every bit of the dinner is eaten before I can take a picture!</p>
<p>It seems as if we are all dealing with a constant&nbsp;struggle with food. &nbsp;Whether eating healthy, not overeating, or getting kids and husbands to try&nbsp;<em>anything<&#47;em>&nbsp;new.&nbsp; I have started researching the idea of food chaining to introduce new foods (for kids and adults!!). &nbsp;It seems like a smart approach and doesn't involve begging, bribing, or starving our kids.</p>
<p>The idea of food chaining is, if your child will&nbsp;only eat chicken nuggets from McDonald, don't try to give them shredded chicken breast tossed in BBQ sauce and assume they will eat it.&nbsp; Start with other chicken nuggets - other restaurants, frozen, then <a title="Homemade Chicken Strips" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;08&#47;homemade-chicken-strips&#47;">homemade<&#47;a>.&nbsp; Then build on that and serve with&nbsp;sauces, like BBQ.&nbsp; Build on it more and serve different flavors of breaded chicken (like my <a title="Coconut Breaded Chicken with Mango Sweet Chili Sauce" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;coconut-chicken&#47;">coconut breaded chicken<&#47;a>, <a title="Tortilla Crusted Chicken Nachos" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;tortilla-crusted-chicken-nachos&#47;">tortilla crusted chicken<&#47;a>,&nbsp;or this chicken parmesan) and different sauces (like ranch, honey mustard, <a title="Teriyaki Sauce" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;teriyaki-sauce&#47;">teriyaki<&#47;a>, or marinara). Then move on to plain cubed, then shredded, chicken or&nbsp;turkey, changing the seasoning and so on until you get to BBQ pulled chicken. &nbsp;It can be a long process, but it beats some of the alternatives and provides better lasting results.</p>
<p>Although my kids are not that&nbsp;picky, it may be because I already was inherently using some of the food chaining principles in my day to day cooking for them. &nbsp;This method is often used for kids with Sensory Processing Disorder, which my son does show some signs of and I love to help other mothers who struggle with their children's eating habits. &nbsp;So, although simple, I want to provide tried and true recipes and directions for those mothers.</p>
<p>In addition, I also want to show you how&nbsp;to cook healthy meals in a way that is not intimidating. It is&nbsp;something that can be done by every home cook for every family.</p>
<p>I chose Chicken Parmesan because was one of the first dishes I learned how to make really well. &nbsp;I started from the instructions on the tub of breadcrumbs and developed it into my own recipe. &nbsp;I would say that it is a dish that helped me learn how to cook - how to deal with chicken breast, how to do a flour-egg-bread process, how to control the heat of a pan, and how to make a great sauce (marinara).</p>
<p>In the past I have typically served my chicken parmesan with a side of pasta. &nbsp;However, that creates a meal that is heavily carb centered with makes me heavily centered around the belly. &nbsp;So I decided I would sub the pasta for spaghetti squash and add zucchini.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m a mom, meals also need to be simpler to prepare.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love to sit at the stove and cook chicken parmesan, but that is a little more difficult now. &nbsp;Not to mention adding two veggies to cook takes additional time. &nbsp;So I decided to simplify and put it all in the oven!</p>
<p>Below&nbsp;is how to make a great, healthy dish simple. If you stay tuned all week I will let you in on what else I did tonight to make addition meals for the rest of the week without much additional work.</p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<h3>Here is your timetable:<&#47;h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Preheat oven to 400 - add spaghetti squash (split lengthwise in a baking dish with a little water) for 45 minutes.<&#47;li>
<li>Prepare Chicken Parmesan (recipe below) and do a little clean up - with about 15 minutes remaining on the squash place the chicken in the oven on a baking sheet for 15 minutes.<&#47;li>
<li>Prepare zucchini: cut into even rounds, then halve or quarter if large. &nbsp;Toss with about 1&#47;2 tablespoon of olive oil per each small zucchini, season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice.<&#47;li>
<li>When the total 45 minutes is up, remove chicken &amp; spaghetti squash from oven, flip chicken, spread prepared zucchini around the chicken (in the empty parts of baking sheet). &nbsp;Bake for another 10 minutes.<&#47;li>
<li>Check spaghetti squash for doneness (can be easily pierced with a fork or taste a small portion to see if the texture is how you like it) return to the oven if needed or let cool (do a little more clean up).<&#47;li>
<li>Remove Chicken and Zucchini from the oven, and pull "noodles" from the spaghetti squash.<&#47;li>
<li>&nbsp;Plate each item, and serve&nbsp;dinner! &nbsp;If you were efficient with your time you should have minimal clean up after you eat.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
