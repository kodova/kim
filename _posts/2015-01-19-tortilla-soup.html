<p>This tortilla soup is another way to use the <a title="Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;slow-cooker-mexican-chicken&#47;">Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken<&#47;a>&nbsp;(or any other leftover or cooked chicken). &nbsp;This is a great soup to put together when you have just a couple minutes to spare. &nbsp;If you have already made the chicken, most of these ingredients may already be in your pantry. &nbsp;All you really need to do is cut up some onion, saute them, throw in some spices, then let it simmer with a can of tomatoes and a box of chicken stock.</p>
<p>A note on the corn tortillas - You only need to fry 6 of them in the oil for the crisp tortilla topping. &nbsp;The remaining will actually go in the soup. &nbsp;Please do not skip this step because it seems unusual! &nbsp;The tortillas not only add flavor to your soup but it also thickens the soup making it hearty and almost creamy without any cream cheese or sour cream that you see in a lot of tortilla soup recipes.</p>
