<p>I think we all are aware of the trend of avocado toast for breakfast. &nbsp;It is my simple go-to breakfast a few times a week!</p>
<p>But are you aware of the trend to eat fermented foods? It is healthy for your gut which more and more studies are showing is important to your overall physical and mental health.</p>
<p>I discovered that Kimchi (a spicy fermented cabbage that is a common Korean side dish) is delicious on avocado toast with fried, scrambled, or poached egg!</p>
<p>A recent study showed that fermented foods help rebalance bad bacteria in your gut after drinking too much alcohol and may be a "hangover" cure! &nbsp;So keep that in mind when you wake up on New Year's Day and try this avocado kimchi toast!!</p>
<p><strong>KIM Tip<&#47;strong></p>
<p>After splitting your avocado in half, use a fork and mash the flesh inside of the peel!</p>
