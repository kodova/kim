<p>It isn't always important to have a super healthy salad. &nbsp;If you have a salad topped with deli meat and tossed with a cream dressing, who cares?! You at least ate your veggies and didn't eat this sandwich everyday for lunch this week:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;Pastrami_Reuben_Sandwich.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-715" alt="Pastrami_Reuben_Sandwich" src="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;Pastrami_Reuben_Sandwich-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>As I promised earlier this week, this Reuben Salad takes all of the ingredients of the above sandwich and turns it into something you don't feel guilty about eating but still completely satisfied. &nbsp;Before making this salad check out my two previous posts: &nbsp;For tips on making salads and dressing see my <a title="Instruction Manual: Salad Dressing" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;salad-dressing&#47;">Instruction Manual: Salad dressing<&#47;a>, and then my <a title="Russian Dressing" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;russian-dressing-2&#47;">Russian Dressing<&#47;a>&nbsp;recipe.</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Quarter the cabbage, remove the core, and then shred<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>I like to shred half a head of cabbage at a time and store it in an air tight container for a quick addition to any salad (if it seems like it is drying out, add a little water)<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>The Russian dressing packs a lot of flavor and this salad can get overdressed easily. &nbsp;Add a little dressing at a time - you only want a very thin coating. &nbsp;If you overdress, add more greens.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>If you don't want to pay attention to the broiler, you can easily throw the croutons and cheese in the microwave for 15 seconds at a time until melted.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>The Sauerkraut is heavy and sticks together, so separate it and sprinkle it over the greens and cabbage. &nbsp;While mixing, make sure it doesn't sink to the bottom.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Want a wrap instead? &nbsp;Just eliminate the croutons and wrap it up in a tortilla.<&#47;em><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
