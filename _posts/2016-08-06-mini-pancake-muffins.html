<p>Are you sick of giving your kids sugary cereal and frozen waffles for breakfast?</p>
<p>An essential in my pantry is my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2016&#47;02&#47;pancake-instruction-manual&#47;">pancake mix<&#47;a> (rather than buying it pre-made you can make your own!). &nbsp;But, mornings can be hectic and to remember to flip a pancake can be hard. &nbsp;If you don't have kids, you might not understand how something so simple can be so difficult.</p>
<p>Enter: Pancake Muffins. &nbsp;Use your typical pancake mix (try my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2016&#47;02&#47;pancake-instruction-manual&#47;">homemade mix<&#47;a>!), stir in a little syrup and whatever you would&nbsp;normally top or mix in (blueberries as pictured above, chocolate chips, bacon), mix it together and portion into a mini muffin tray and bake. &nbsp;Go make your <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;05&#47;cold-brewed-iced-coffee&#47;">coffee<&#47;a>, get the kids dressed, pack <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2016&#47;08&#47;lunch-boxes-for-the-new-school-year&#47;">lunch boxes<&#47;a>, whatever else you need to do! Breakfast will be ready when you are.</p>
<p>My kids are incredibly unpredictable when it comes to how many pancakes they will eat. Sometimes they will eat two other times 5 or 6! &nbsp;What is great about Pancake Muffins is that they are freezable, so you can make them ahead or freeze any leftovers. &nbsp;Just cool completely and place in a freezer bag. &nbsp;To reheat, microwave on high for 30 seconds at a time.</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a cookie or ice cream scoop to help evenly fill the muffin cups, I used the medium one in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;2ayB2XY">this<&#47;a> set for this recipe<&#47;li>
<li>When you are Meal Planning (see ideas <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2016&#47;07&#47;back-to-school-meal-planning&#47;">here<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">here<&#47;a>), make the muffins on a batch cooking day<&#47;li>
<li>You could do larger muffins, but cooking times will vary and I have not tried it. &nbsp;You can find a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;2apjp7a">mini muffin pan<&#47;a> on Amazon for about $12 or in most stores.<&#47;li><br />
