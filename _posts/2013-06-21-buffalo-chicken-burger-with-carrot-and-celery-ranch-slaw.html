<p>This burger is the perfect mashup of a hamburger and chicken wings. &nbsp;My husband is a traditionalist when it comes to pub classics like pizza, burgers, and chicken wing, and even he was impressed and enjoyed this&nbsp;sandwich.</p>
<p>Often restaurants will offer a buffalo style chicken sandwich using a chicken breast. &nbsp;Which you can do at home, but often that might come out dry and the texture is not the same of a tradition hamburger. &nbsp;You can use ground chicken from the store, but I chose to grind it myself. &nbsp;I used equal parts light and dark meat. &nbsp;Simply season the meat with some spices and Frank's hot sauce and form it into a patty. &nbsp;For more buffalo sauce flavor, I basted the patty after the cooking was completed.</p>
<p>Rather than serving the burger with lettuce, tomato and ranch or blue cheese sauce, I topped it with a slaw of the typical side of carrots and celery.</p>
