<p>One of my favorite desserts is apple crisps&nbsp;with ice cream. &nbsp;However that is not something I should eat everyday! &nbsp;This may not be an everyday breakfast either, but it is easy to keep the parts around and throw together on a morning that you need something extra to get going, or for a special breakfast over the weekend.</p>
<p>My kids love waffles. &nbsp;So this is a great way to give them a breakfast that they will eat all of to keep them going throughout the morning. &nbsp;Plus it has a serving a fruits!</p>
<p>There is no recipe here! &nbsp;It is simply composed of a toasted waffle (I use Van's Power Grains or Gluten Free Ancient Grains), a spoonful of my <a title="Apple Pie Topping" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;apple-pie-topping&#47;">Apple Pie Topping<&#47;a> (that can be frozen for months) and sprinkled with Granola. &nbsp;You could use my homemade <a title="Cinnamon-Cranberry Granola" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;cinnamon-cranberry-granola&#47;">Cinnamon-Cranberry Granola<&#47;a>&nbsp;or store bought. &nbsp;However, try to choose one that has cinnamon as that will give you the right flavors of an apple crisp.</p>
