<p>Deviled eggs are a staple at most of my family gatherings. &nbsp;It is hard to restrain myself and eat just one or two. &nbsp;However, there is no need to restrain from these! &nbsp;In fact, you can feel good about making these a regular snack.</p>
<p>We all know that eggs are a good source of protein. &nbsp;But the mayo that is in most deviled eggs is loaded with fat and calories. &nbsp;So I replaced the mayo with <a title="Roasted Red Pepper Hummus" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;04&#47;roasted-red-pepper-hummus&#47;">Roasted Red Pepper Hummus<&#47;a>. &nbsp;Hummus is full of protein,&nbsp;it is also a good source of fiber and good-for-you carbs.</p>
<p>Like my <a title="Quick &amp; Easy Peanut Butter Dip" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;04&#47;quick-easy-peanut-butter-dip&#47;">Peanut Butter dip<&#47;a>, this is also just two ingredients! &nbsp;Although I provide a recipe, it is just a starting point. &nbsp;Add as much or as little of your favorite&nbsp;hummus to the egg yolks until it tastes good to you.</p>
<p>KIM Tip: &nbsp;I don't use any fancy or complicated&nbsp;method to get a perfect hard boiled egg. &nbsp;Instead, I use an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00004UE75&#47;ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004UE75&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20&amp;linkId=BK4BKHUKVO67772P">Egg Timer<&#47;a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http:&#47;&#47;ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com&#47;e&#47;ir?t=kitchinstrman-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00004UE75" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" &#47;>. &nbsp;Its as simple as putting the timer in the water with your eggs, bringing it to a boil, and cooking until the timer indicates that it is at a hard.</p>
