<p>I'm constantly trying to cook more from scratch. &nbsp;Some recipes easily replace store-bought products, others fall short. &nbsp;I have made several different granola bars but they have never been what I was looking for. &nbsp;So I continued&nbsp;buying processed versions. &nbsp;One thing&nbsp;I realized - my favorite store-bought varieties have some sort of puffed grain. &nbsp;So although they were "chewy" they still have a crunch or crisp. &nbsp;I also liked peanut butter flavored bars. &nbsp;So I simply put those two items together and found this great recipe.</p>
<p>These granola bars are so easy to put together. &nbsp;And the more you make them, the faster it will come together. &nbsp;To speed it up, you can leave off the white chocolate topping, but it brings the bar to another level.</p>
<p>Granola bars are adaptable, so you can add additional ingredients like dried fruit, nuts, ground flax, protein powder, etc. &nbsp;If you have never made a granola bar from scratch, my suggestion is that you follow the recipe the first time and then make adjustments the second time.</p>
<p>Whats awesome about these bars besides&nbsp;being delicious, easy to make, and easy to customize? &nbsp;They also don't require an oven!! &nbsp;Which may not be a big deal for some of you, but I live in Arizona&nbsp;and we are already regularly hitting 90+ (it is only April...) &nbsp;I spend most of the year baking at night, early morning, or avoiding the oven all together; so it is nice to have a recipe that doesn't heat up my kitchen.</p>
<p>These bars can be healthy, but only as healthy as the individual ingredients you choose. &nbsp;You can choose a brown rice cereal or one that is high in sugar;&nbsp;a natural peanut butter or one that has added sugar; a pure maple syrup or colored high fructose corn syrup.</p>
<h2>KIM Tips:<&#47;h2><br />
You may not need to use all of the "liquid" mixture. &nbsp;Add most of the liquids to the oats and puffed rice and stir to combine. &nbsp;If it seems some of the oats aren't covered and still look dry, add the remaining liquid ingredients.</p>
<p>What is "puffed rice cereal"? You may know it as Rice Krispies! &nbsp;There are many options now including brown rice and gluten free versions. &nbsp;If you are trying to <a title="Pantry Clean Out &ndash; Lessons Learned" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;pantry-clean-out-lessons-learned&#47;">clean out your pantry<&#47;a> this is a great recipe to use the last of the cereal!</p>
<p>If your bars fall apart (as many of mine did) add more liquid ingredients next time or try storing in the fridge to keep the peanut butter and coconut oil in a more firm state. &nbsp;Another option is to spray oil on top to add more moisture.</p>
<p>To make measuring the syrup and peanut butter easier swirl the coconut oil in the measuring cups first (melt the coconut oil if its solid).</p>
