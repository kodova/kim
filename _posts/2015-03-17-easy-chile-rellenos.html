<p>When I got <a title="Produce On Wheels &ndash; Preserving veggies" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;produce-on-wheels&#47;">all that cheap produce<&#47;a> this past weekend I&nbsp;sat down with <a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">my meal planner<&#47;a>&nbsp;to determine what veggies I wanted to create our dinners around this week. &nbsp;The first thing that popped in my head was chile rellenos with the poblanos. &nbsp;The second was chicken gyros with the tomatoes and cucumbers, which I was already thinking about making, I'll share that tomorrow.</p>
<p>I made a few changes to the traditional chile relleno - a roasted chile, stuffed with cheese, battered and fried. &nbsp;First, I wanted this to be a main meal for my family without too many side dishes. &nbsp;So I decided to stuff the chile with cheese, ground chicken (beef, pork, or turkey could be used as well) and diced tomatoes.</p>
<p>The assembly of a traditional chile relleno also needed to be changed. &nbsp;The careful splitting and stuffing and closing with a toothpick was too tedious for the time I had and the likelihood that I would be interrupted by kids. &nbsp;So instead I cut open the roasted pepper, removed the stem and seeds, stuffed it, and rolled&#47;folded it back up.</p>
<p>To still get some batter, I took spoonfuls and spread it thinly on a cast iron skillet that had been heated with a little bit of oil - essentially making a batter round that I placed under the chile. &nbsp;You need to keep it thin, or it will seem like a bad&nbsp;mix of fried and&nbsp;scrambled eggs! &nbsp;As far as I am aware this isn't really a practiced method, but I had every intention of doing it the right way but realized I couldn't that particular evening after all the ingredients were prepared.</p>
<p>KIM Kid tip: &nbsp;I served just the filling and the batter rounds to the kids. &nbsp;They haven't particularly cared for spicy things lately so I omitted the pepper completely. &nbsp;I will however introduce roasted poblanos to them in a less direct way.</p>
