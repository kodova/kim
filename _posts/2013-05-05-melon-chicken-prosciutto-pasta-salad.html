<p>Pasta salads are great for potlucks, picnics, and BBQs. &nbsp;But they can also be enjoyed at home and dare I say it? with a glass of wine.</p>
<p>But that requires a special kind of pasta salad. &nbsp;One that has more flavor than one of the classics you always see at parties; whether is is macaroni mixed with mayo or the more complicated Italian version of pasta, olives, salami, cheese cubes, some standard veggie (but not a lot of it) all tossed with a plain vinaigrette.</p>
<h3>History of Pasta Salad<&#47;h3><br />
The history of pasta salad is rooted in Nouvelle Cuisine. &nbsp;In the 1960s and 70s Nouvelle Cuisine was the newest cooking trend (nouvelle = new in french). &nbsp;Among other things, it was known for the rejection of overly complicated cooking styles, the use of gourmet pasta, and using healthy and fresh ingredients. Near the end of this trend in the 1980s was when the pasta salad really took off. &nbsp;It was an affordable, simple way to use leftover ingredients. &nbsp;Then it became overly simple when food manufacturers began to sell pasta salad kits in boxes.</p>
<p>Lets take pasta salad back to its origins at Nouvelle chefs probably intended it to be: not overly complicated, fresh ingredients, and healthy.</p>
<p>This pasta salad has just as much fruits and vegetables as there is pasta. &nbsp;Then you have the addition of protein from chicken and great flavor additions from prosciutto and dried cranberries. &nbsp;If you want to come up with your own rendition use the following formula: &nbsp;1 part pasta, 1 part vegetables and fruit (choose two different fruits or veggies), 1&#47;2 part protein, and 1&#47;4 part of any flavor enhancers (in this recipe prosciutto and cranberries). &nbsp;Tip: just replace "parts" with "cups" for a small recipe.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Cooking tip:&nbsp;<&#47;strong> Cooking the pasta according to package directions will usually leave you with a mushy pasta. &nbsp;For al dente pasta, just take a minute off of the length of time the package suggests to boil the pasta. &nbsp;If it is the first time you are cooking with a brand or shape of pasta, I recommend to start checking about 2-3 minutes prior to when the package says it will be done. &nbsp;Al dente pasta will help the texture of the salad by allowing each piece of pasta to be felt individually in your mouth.</p>
