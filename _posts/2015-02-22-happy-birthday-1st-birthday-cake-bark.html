<p>It is my daughter's first birthday!! &nbsp;The year has gone by so fast. &nbsp;I love the idea of the smash cakes everyone does for a child's first birthday. &nbsp;However, cake is not my favorite sweet treat and I hate decorating&nbsp;a homemade cake beyond a simple single layer of frosting.</p>
<p>I was recently watching ABC's The Chew and they showed <a title="The Chew Cake Bark" href="http:&#47;&#47;abc.go.com&#47;shows&#47;the-chew&#47;recipes&#47;cake-batter-bark-clinton-kelly" target="_blank">this idea for a cake bark<&#47;a>. &nbsp;I got the brilliant idea of making a "smash bark" rather than a cake for my daughter's first birthday this weekend.</p>
<p>At first Zariah just&nbsp;played with the sprinkles. &nbsp;Buy then took the hammer and started banging the sheet of chocolate and cake batter. &nbsp;I did have to help break it apart (it would have helped if we had it raised above the table since it didn't come directly out of the freezer and therefore was not as brittle).</p>
