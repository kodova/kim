<p>The Holiday Season is almost here... Halloween is just a few short days away which means the start of unhealthy eating habits for most of us. &nbsp;Right now I'm making a&nbsp;resolution to have a healthier holiday season&nbsp;so&nbsp;that I don't need to make a New Year's resolution to loose weight. &nbsp;I will indulge in candy and many unhealthy oversized meals. Thats a fact. &nbsp;So how can&nbsp;I be healthier? &nbsp;By making more of my own food, starting with these Peanut Butter Cups!</p>
<p>Don't want to make your own candy? Head on over to Faith and Food to see my post on some other ways to have a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;csfaithandfood.com&#47;healthy-choices&#47;tips-for-a-healthier-halloween&#47;" target="_blank">healthier halloween<&#47;a>!</p>
<p>KIM Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use silicone muffin cups like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1NmcwSm" target="_blank">these<&#47;a> on Amazon. &nbsp;The candy will come out much easier and cleaner.<&#47;li>
<li>I suggest rice flour in the recipe&nbsp;to keep it gluten-free, but if its not in your pantry then use regular flour.<&#47;li>
<li>If your house is warm and your peanut butter mixture is runny, you may want to refrigerate the cups before adding the final layer of chocolate to prevent the two layers from mixing.<&#47;li>
<li>If you don't have patience to create the cups, melt the chocolate and pour into the bottom of a parchment lined loaf pan then swirl in the peanut butter.<&#47;li>
<li>Use a natural, smooth&#47;creamy peanut butter (ingredients should only be peanuts and maybe salt).<&#47;li>
<li>Try to find a Dark chocolate with 70% or more cocoa.<&#47;li>
<li>I list Maple syrup as optional. &nbsp;My goal is for taste buds to adapt to no added sugar in most recipes. &nbsp;I encourage you to try it without the added sugar - I didn't miss it!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Have a Healthier Happy Halloween!</p>
