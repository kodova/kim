<p>Apple Pie may seems like a flavor that is reserved for fall. &nbsp;But unlike Pumpkin Pie, Apples season is long and is ending soon (although you can get apples all year). &nbsp;Because it is the end of the season, some apples may be best used for cooking rather than eaten raw. &nbsp;And who doesn't wish that after making apple pie that there is leftover filling? &nbsp;This is a quick and simple stovetop recipe that can be frozen or used in a variety of ways - like in oatmeal or yogurt. &nbsp;Check back to see&nbsp;other ways to use them!</p>
<h2>KIM Tips<&#47;h2><br />
Choosing your apples: &nbsp;The type is preference... choose what is cheap or what you enjoy. &nbsp;I like granny smith for almost everything! &nbsp;If you want to cut out the added honey, choose a variety that is sweet - cook it without the honey and taste (adding honey if its not sweet enough). &nbsp;Choose apples that are firm and unbruised. &nbsp;Shape doesn't matter!</p>
<p>Peeling: I use a paring knife to peel my apples. &nbsp;It is small so it fits in your hand nicely. &nbsp;First, I peel a section around the the stem. Then I peel 1&#47;2 - 1 inch at a time down the side. &nbsp;Then clean up the bottom. &nbsp;Find out what I did with the leftover peels <a title="Apple Whiskey" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;apple-whiskey&#47;" target="_blank">in this post<&#47;a>&nbsp;(it involves alcohol!).</p>
<p>Cutting: Cut off four sides around the core. &nbsp;Lay flat and cut into 1&#47;4-1&#47;2 inch strips. &nbsp;If your apple was fat, you might want to cut some strips in half. &nbsp;Then cut cubes from each strip.</p>
