<p>Children depend on their parents for food, but eventually that dependency needs to be broken. &nbsp;You may be busy working or tending to&nbsp;another child &nbsp;and can't prepare&nbsp;food every time it is demanded (breastfeeding moms know that is hard to feed two kids at once!). &nbsp;You could value teaching your kids independence from a young age (Montessori educational theory) and food is one of the most basic needs that kids&nbsp;need to learn how to fulfill. &nbsp;Or you could just be sick of your child asking for food every waking hour!</p>
<p>Many parents lean on prepared snacks like string cheese, packs of goldfish, fruit snacks, and the like to get their kids fed quickly. &nbsp;These are also common school lunch snack, and this is the time of year that kids are starting back at school. &nbsp;You may be&nbsp;energized enough to prepare great lunches at the start of the school year, but as the weeks&nbsp;go on it will get more difficult. &nbsp;These snacks can easily be prepared earlier in the week and even your kids can put them in their lunch box!</p>
<p>Lunch box? How about lunch sack for work? &nbsp;These are not just kid friendly snacks. &nbsp;They are also snacks that as an adult could take with you to work as a part of a healthy work lunch!</p>
<p>Lets break the bad snack habit. &nbsp;Lets&nbsp;start to&nbsp;teach our&nbsp;<a title="Kid&rsquo;s Kitchen Instruction Manual" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;tools-for-cooking-with-kids&#47;">kids to cook<&#47;a>&nbsp;or simply serve themselves food.</p>
<h3>KIM Snack Tips<&#47;h3><br />
First you need to clean out a spot in your fridge and pantry to keep the snacks. &nbsp;For kids, this spot should be low and easy to access. &nbsp;If you have a fridge with a bottom freezer, use a low shelf that they can reach (I use the lowest tray on the fridge door). &nbsp;In the pantry, keep a basket (a simple one from&nbsp;the dollar store will do) on a low shelf or use a pull out shelf.</p>
<p>Next, either choose to use plastic zip top bags or easy to open containers. &nbsp;If your child is young they may not be able to open a zip top bag. &nbsp;In addition, consider small containers to hold hummus, peanut butter, or other dips. &nbsp;I like the size of the <a title="OXO Tot Block on Amazon" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1JsHqZ9">OXO Tot Blocks<&#47;a>&nbsp;but you could even use empty baby food jars. &nbsp;For work, choose ones that are easily stackable so they fit nicely in a lunch sack, your work fridge, or on your desk.</p>
<p>Set aside 15 minutes one or two days a week to prepare the snack (best time is after your shopping trips or during a dinner that has some down time). &nbsp;Have your kids help by counting out pieces, using a scoop, or simply putting the lid on containers.</p>
<p>Some weeks your kids will eat more than others. &nbsp;To&nbsp;prevent spoilage choose a balance of non-perishable items like nuts and dried fruit to&nbsp;fresh fruit, vegetables, and dairy.</p>
