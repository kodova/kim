<p>Happy Pancake Day!!! &nbsp;Yesterday I gave you an <a title="Instruction Manual &ndash; Pancakes (with Pancake Mix recipe)" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;pancake-instruction-manual&#47;">Instruction Manual on Pancakes<&#47;a>&nbsp;that gave you a pancake mix recipe so you are prepared to have pancakes on any given day. &nbsp;Because you have the mix ready, you can start experimenting with mix ins and toppings.</p>
<p>These pancakes&nbsp;have banana rounds in the center are lightly caramelized. &nbsp;All you do is place a thin slice of banana in your pan, then cover it with pancake batter and continue as normal. &nbsp;You can top it with maple syrup, toasted walnuts, cinnamon, or more bananas.</p>
<p>Kids love these because they are mini pancakes and can easily be eaten in one hand,&nbsp;and I have yet to find a kid that doesn't like bananas. &nbsp;We buy a bunch of bananas nearly every time we are at the grocery store.</p>

<p>What ways do you change up your standard pancakes?</p>
