<p>Whenever it is time to heat up the grills, Teriyaki seems to be a popular smell throughout the neighborhood.... maybe the frozen, pre-marinated bag of chicken from Costco or a store bought bottle of teriyaki sauce. &nbsp;Even so many of my extended family BBQs have consisted of simple salads&nbsp;with grilled chicken marinated in bottled&nbsp;teriyaki sauce. &nbsp;Its not terrible, in fact it is a quick and easy meal. &nbsp;But I am a proponent of making as much as possible&nbsp;from scratch. &nbsp;It is cheaper, healthier, and one less bottle to store in the "condiment" buckets in the fridge. &nbsp;In the past I have discussed my determination of eliminating salad dressing (which I have not in over 6 months), but I also make many of my own condiments and all marinades.</p>
<p>Teriyaki is a simple mix of common ingredients, all of which you should keep in your healthy <a title="What Should be in my Pantry?" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;what-should-be-in-my-pantry&#47;">pantry<&#47;a>&nbsp;to make quick&nbsp;and flavorful meals: &nbsp;soy sauce, orange juice (or mirin if you have it), honey, garlic&nbsp;and ginger (ginger freezes great by the way).</p>
<p>Ideas For Using Teriyaki Sauce</p>
<ul>
<li>Marinade chicken, beef, or salmon then grill or bake.<&#47;li>
<li>Grill pineapple then brush a thin layer of sauce on.<&#47;li>
<li>Mix in brown rice for a quick side dish to another Asian entree.<&#47;li>
<li>As a sauce for grilled or baked broccoli or carrots.<&#47;li>
<li>Follow the proportions in my Instruction Manual for salad dressing and add apple cider vinegar and olive oil for any salad (choose&nbsp;vegetables like&nbsp;romaine, cabbage, green onions, carrots, and sesame seeds).<&#47;li>
<li>Use in fish likes my Teriyaki Salmon Cakes<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a double batch and put&nbsp;a pound of chicken, beef, or salmon with 1&#47;2-3&#47;4 of a cup of sauce in a zip top bag and store in the freezer for a last minute dinner.<&#47;li>
<li>For a thicker sauce to drizzle over top of your meal, put the ingredients in a small sauce pot and bring to a simmer. &nbsp;In a small bowl mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or arrowroot powder with 1 tablespoon water and whisk until combined. &nbsp;Add to the sauce pot and simmer until thickened.<&#47;li>
<li>If you are using raw honey, melt&nbsp;so it can dissolve throughout the sauce.<&#47;li>
<li>Strain out the ginger and garlic for a cleaner looking sauce.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
