<p>Pizza is a meal that many families enjoy regularly, including my own. &nbsp;It usually is one of those meals that I choose because I don't want to cook, I don't have a meal planned, my kids haven't been eating anything I make, I'm stressed, or my husband has a craving that can only be satisfied by pizza. &nbsp;Really, I can come up with any reason to get pizza!</p>
<p>Even if you don't eat a lot of pizza, the same dough can be used for many different things. &nbsp;You can make a filled dough ball or a pocket&#47;calzone filled with anything from vegetables to sausage and eggs.</p>
<p>I have found that pizza dough is easier than most breads, especially when it comes to doughs&nbsp;with whole wheat. &nbsp;The hardest part is the flour to water ratio which I find very temperamental depending on the&nbsp;season and humidity. &nbsp;I suggest to start with the ratios provided, then add either a couple tablespoon of flour or a teaspoon of water at a time depending on if the dough is too wet or dry, respectively. &nbsp;As time goes on you will be able to tell how much flour or water you need to add to get the right consistency.</p>
<h2>KIM Tips<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>You can store the dough in the fridge for up to 3 days (it may take on some sourdough like flavor and smells, which is fantastic!)<&#47;li>
<li>You can wrap extra&nbsp;dough in plastic wrap and put in a zip top bag and freeze it<&#47;li>
<li>For an easy make ahead pizza, you can roll the dough into a pizza crust, bake at 450 for 10 minutes, let cool, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze. &nbsp;When ready to cook, just top the crust with sauce, cheese and other toppings and bake at 450 until cheese is melted<&#47;li>
<li>Whole wheat flour can go bad quickly. &nbsp;Keep it fresh by buying bulk and only what you need for a couple weeks or store it in and air tight bag in the freezer.<&#47;li>
<li>If your yeast does not foam in the first step, it has gone bad and the dough will not rise. &nbsp;Replace your yeast and start again!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
