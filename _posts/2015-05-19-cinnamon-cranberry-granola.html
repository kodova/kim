<p>Granola is&nbsp;one of my son's favorites foods. &nbsp;It was one of the first things he learned&nbsp;to ask for. &nbsp;If I said we were having yogurt for breakfast or a snack, he immediately said "granola" and went to the cupboard to&nbsp;pull it out.</p>
<p>We try to eat processed free as much as possible. &nbsp;Since granola is something we eat regularly it is on my list of things we always make from scratch. &nbsp;I encourage you to look at the food you eat, if you consume it twice a week or more, you should take the time to learn to make it from scratch.</p>
<p>Granola is so flexible. &nbsp;So take this recipe as a little bit of a guide... Substitute whatever sweetener, nuts, seeds, or dried fruit that you have in your pantry or that you love in your favorite store bought variety.</p>
<p>I am sharing this particular recipe because it is a healthy version of granola. &nbsp;It uses clean ingredients as well as ones that have lots of health benefits that we don't always think about.</p>
<p>Cranberry: &nbsp;Cranberry's most popular health benefit is probably&nbsp;relief from urinary tract infections. &nbsp;But it also reduces heart rick and sustains cardiovascular health, it prevents tooth decay and cavities, can cure sore throat and cold, helps avoid respiratory infections, effective against lung inflammation, reduces the risk of stomach ulcers, and prevents kidney stones (source <a title="Health Benefits of Cranberry Juice" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.organicfacts.net&#47;health-benefits&#47;fruit&#47;health-benefits-of-cranberry-juice.html" target="_blank">OrganicFacts.net<&#47;a>).</p>
<p>Cinnamon: &nbsp;Did you know that cinnamon has antioxidants? &nbsp;We have all heard that antioxidants are healthy (and often use it as an excuse to drink red wine!), they help fight the dangerous free radicals in our bodies. &nbsp;Cinnamon also helps with inflammation, cuts risk of heart disease, can improve the body's sensitivity to insulin, lower blood sugar levels, protect against cancer and much more!</p>
<p>Wheat Germ: Wheat germ is a powerhouse of nutrients and is often referred to as a natural weight-loss food. It's a good source of some of the B vitamins (important for cardiovascular health, mood, and important during pregnancy), and the minerals phosphorus, zinc, iron, selenium and potassium. Our body needs minerals to repair itself and run the chemical reactions that keep us healthy. Wheat germs is also high in fiber, which helps blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and protein.</p>
