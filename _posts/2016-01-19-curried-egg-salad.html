<p>I received several loafs of bread for free one day and realized I was going to need to come up with some new sandwiches. &nbsp;I have nothing against the traditional egg salad, but it wasn't something that I was craving or felt particularly healthy about. &nbsp;I came across the idea of a curried egg salad and what was appealing to me, besides the curry powder and cumin, because of&nbsp;the addition of granny smith apples. &nbsp;The apples add a nice crispness to the creaminess of the eggs and greek yogurt (which I substituted for the traditional mayonnaise).</p>
<p>This is a great protein packed lunch. You can wrap it in a tortilla and pack for work or school. &nbsp;Or even wrapped in lettuce or straight from a bowl for a carb&#47;gluten free option!</p>
<p>If you get&nbsp;your kids involved in making this, or any, recipe they will be more likely to eat it. &nbsp;I do most of the cutting (onions and apple) and let my son (3 years) use an&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;20oYTbn" target="_blank">egg slicer<&#47;a> to "dice" the eggs and then he helps measure and mix everything together.</p>
<p>It stays fresh for several days which is great for weeks that you know you need to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;" target="_blank">meal plan<&#47;a> and prep over the weekends.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tricks to create the perfect hard boiled egg. &nbsp;I simply use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1QvCeYa" target="_blank">this Norpro Egg timer<&#47;a>. &nbsp;You fill you pan up with water, eggs, and this timer. &nbsp;As you cook your eggs the timer gets darker and once it gets to the line you desire (soft&#47;medium&#47;hard) you pull out your eggs and toss them in a bowl of ice water. &nbsp;This allows me to walk around and do other things and never have to be precise about when to turn off the heat or drop the eggs into boiling water! &nbsp;The only time I have overcooked my eggs and got the unpleasant greenish color around the outside was when I forgot about the eggs!</p>
