<p>Although citrus can be found year round, from November through January is when it is at its peak here in Arizona. &nbsp;Because many of us have citrus trees (or our friends or family do) I thought an Instruction Manual on citrus would be helpful! &nbsp;If you are outside of the few states that grow citrus, it is still important to know how to buy, store, and prepare your lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruit, etc.</p>
<p>If you currently use bottled lemon or lime juice, taste it and notice the strange flavor it has. &nbsp;If it doesn't taste&nbsp;strange to you, taste it next to fresh citrus juice. &nbsp;When lemon juice is bottled it is watered down and sugar and preservatives are added. &nbsp;It may stay for a long time in your fridge, but consider how long those toxins might stay in your body! &nbsp;Using fresh citrus will also immediately improve the flavors in the dishes you cook.</p>
<h2>Buying or Picking Citrus<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid blemishes or bruises or ones that are soft and spongy - the flesh may be damaged.<&#47;li>
<li>Look for ones that are heavy for their size (pick two same size and feel for differences, repeat until you understand what is heavy and light - this will eventually become second nature).<&#47;li>
<li>Larger citrus are likely to have more juice than smaller ones - the rind on small lemons tend to be thicker than larger ones leaving you with less flesh.<&#47;li>
<li>Organic or Conventional? If you do not plan to eat the peel then it is ok to buy conventional as the peel protects the inner flesh. &nbsp;Buy organic if you plan to zest or use the peel for other uses. If organic is not available or in your budget then use a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;instruction-manual-cleaning-produce&#47;">produce wash<&#47;a>&nbsp;to clean them.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<h2>Storing Citrus<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>You can keep citrus on your countertop for about a week, however it will start to loose moisture and start to shrivel.<&#47;li>
<li>For longer storage, place in a zip top bag in your fridge for a month (do not use the produce bags from the grocery store as they are too thin and do not provide as good of a seal).<&#47;li>
<li>Zest citrus and store in a zip top bag in your freezer for about 6 months.<&#47;li>
<li>Juice your citrus, place into ice cube trays, freeze, and transfer to a zip top bag.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<h2>Tools for Citrus<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>You can simply use tools you already have - the side of a box grater or a vegetable peeler can be used to remove the zest of the citrus, a fork can be inserted into the flesh and twisted to juice. &nbsp;You can also use your hands or place the citrus half in the middle of tongs to squeeze out juice.<&#47;li>
<li>There are plenty of options for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1Y178co" target="_blank">citrus juicers<&#47;a> - I typically use a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1Y17b8f" target="_blank">wood reamer like this one<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>There are also plenty of options for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;20IBMtm" target="_blank">zesting<&#47;a>, find one that is most appealing to you as they all have positive uses.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<h2>Tips<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>When zesting citrus, avoid the white pith as it is bitter.<&#47;li>
<li>Be sure to remove the seeds by straining through your fingers or a strainer - seeds also add bitterness.<&#47;li>
<li>Always zest before juicing! It is easier to remove the zest while the fruit is still fully in tact.<&#47;li>
<li>Before juicing, roll the citrus between the palm of your hand and the counter to help loosen the juice.<&#47;li>
<li>Grill either slices to halves for a unique, smokey, and sweet flavor.<&#47;li>
<li>Zest can add a large punch of flavor without the acid.<&#47;li>
<li>Use as an acid in a salad dressing (see my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;salad-dressing&#47;">Salad Dressing Instruction Manual <&#47;a>for ideas).<&#47;li>
<li>Mandarines and Tangerines are great <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;self-serving-snacks-for-kids&#47;">snacks for kids<&#47;a>&nbsp;or lunches.<&#47;li>
<li>Navel Oranges are good for eating, Valencia are great for juicing (but have a stringy unpleasant texture).<&#47;li>
<li>Pink or Ruby Red Grapefruit are best for eating straight.<&#47;li><br />
