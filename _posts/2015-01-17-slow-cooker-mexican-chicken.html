<p>Chances are if you have looked at a dozen "Slow Cooker" recipes you have seen the 2 ingredient meal: Chicken and Salsa. &nbsp;A two ingredient dish sounds appealing, but I was hesitant. &nbsp;Could this really be any good? &nbsp;But the result was a tender, flavorful chicken that is so versatile. &nbsp;Just be sure you use a salsa you like!</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with slow cooker meals is that one recipe is often WAY more than my family can eat. &nbsp;In order to get my husband to eat leftovers I have to repurpose them until the original dish is almost unrecognizable. &nbsp;Then there is my little one. &nbsp;One week I was sick, so I pulled out some freezer dinners I had previously made and my toddler was offered baked ziti a couple days in a row. &nbsp;Even though he loves baked ziti, he got tired of it. &nbsp;When it was placed in front of him for a third time he refused to touch it. &nbsp;Instead, he walked into the kitchen, pointed at the stove, looked at me and said "cook". &nbsp;Now, he is not a very verbal boy and this was probably the first time he said the word cook! &nbsp;I had no idea that at such a young age he would understand what it meant to cook good food and to eat a variety of foods. &nbsp;I have heard so many times that toddlers go through phases where they only want to eat the same things. So far that has not been the case with JJ. &nbsp;Which can make life difficult when I just want him to eat a PB&amp;J!</p>
<p>So when I have a slow cooker recipe I need to either accept that I am the only one eating the leftovers or I need to have a plan to repurpose them.</p>
<p>You can and will want to eat this chicken straight out of the pot. &nbsp;But this simple recipe gives you a chicken that can be incorporated into many different dishes as I will show you over the week. &nbsp;The plan is budget friendly as not only are the ingredients reasonably priced, but also uses similar ingredients so you don't have lots of excess food (like half a stack of corn tortillas!).</p>
<p>KIM Slow Cooker Tips</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Follow the recipe. &nbsp;That means use the right amount of meat, liquid, and the right size pot! &nbsp;Spices can be altered to your taste.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Keep the lid closed. &nbsp;It is tempting to get a bigger whiff of the food you are cooking, but an open lid causes problems. &nbsp;Lifting the lid decreases the temperature and can increase the time need to cook by 20-30 minutes every time you lift the lid. &nbsp;It also can cause your meat to dry out.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Don't let raw meat sit in the pot at room temperature. &nbsp;If you want to put together all of the ingredients in a complicated recipe the night before or before you need to turn on the slow cooker then remove the pot and place it in the fridge until it is time to cook.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Shred and rest the meat in the crock pot if possible. &nbsp;It will help keep it moist.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>If you choose to use chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs, add 1&#47;2 cup of chicken stock so it doesn't dry out.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>A multi-functioning slow cooker is helpful in reducing the number of dishes when you have a recipe where some&nbsp;saut&eacute;ing&nbsp;is required. &nbsp;I use the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B008YEXC22&#47;ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008YEXC22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20&amp;linkId=LGAH6D53BO2W774O">Cuisinart 3-In-1 Cook Central<&#47;a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com&#47;e&#47;ir?t=kitchinstrman-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B008YEXC22" width="1" height="1" border="0" &#47;><br />
