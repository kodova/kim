<p>I love the idea of root to stalk and nose to tail cooking. &nbsp;Using every part of a plant or animal is a great way to be mindful of the earth and also to save money. &nbsp;Usually my corn husks and cobs go straight into my compost.... Not anymore! &nbsp;Now they go into a pot of water to make a corn stock first.</p>
<p>To get the most corn flavor, first "toast" the husks. &nbsp;This can be done a couple of ways. &nbsp;If I am hanging outside while I have some cobs on the grill, I will place a few at a time&nbsp;on the upper rack of my gas grill. &nbsp;You could put them directly on the grill, but make sure your heat is low or they will burn. &nbsp;The grill&nbsp;toasts them quick, but requires you to keep a close eye on them. If you don't want to pay close attention to them, then you can lay them on a sheet pan weighted down with a cooling rack. &nbsp;Bake at 350 for about 15 minutes, tossing halfway through to allow for even cooking.</p>
<p>Just like any other stock, vegetable, <a title="Chicken Stock" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2014&#47;11&#47;chicken-stock&#47;">chicken<&#47;a> or beef, you can either simmer in a large stock pot for a long time or you can use a pressure cooker. &nbsp;I have directions below for a standard pot since a pressure cooker is not available to everyone. &nbsp;For a pressure cooker - place all ingredients in the pot, bring to pressure, let cook for 45 minutes then depressurize naturally or using the cold water method.</p>
<p>This stock can be made&nbsp;with however many corn husks and cobs you have available. &nbsp;Use about one cup of water per ears of corn. &nbsp;I haven't tried it, but if you only have a couple you could freeze the cobs (and possibly the husks too) and use them when you have more corn or additional vegetables for a more traditional vegetable stock.</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;grill or cook the corn before using the cob for stock. &nbsp;Or you can cut the kernels off raw.</p>
<p>Use the stock as you would any vegetable stock. &nbsp;I used it in a Corn and Chorizo soup (check back soon for the recipe!).</p>
