<p>I have this problem - I know green tea is extremely good for me, but I can't drink&nbsp;it. &nbsp;I love my morning coffee and I'm not willing to give that up (I've tried!) <em>and<&#47;em> I live in Arizona. &nbsp;If I wanted to drink tea in the afternoon it is way too hot most of the year (its September and still over&nbsp;100 degrees).</p>
<p>In case you aren't aware, here are some of the health benefits of green tea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can help with weight loss by increasing metabolism<&#47;li>
<li>Helps regulate blood glucose levels<&#47;li>
<li>May help prevent heart disease and some forms of cancer<&#47;li>
<li>Reduces bad cholesterol while raising good cholesterol<&#47;li>
<li>Prevent mental decay in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's<&#47;li>
<li>Has strong anti-viral and anti-bacterial agents<&#47;li>
<li>Can help with memory by improving the brain connections that process and store information<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
And&nbsp;again I wonder why it took me so long to start drinking green tea every day!</p>
<p>I ran across <a title="Hot Tea vs. Iced Tea" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.prevention.com&#47;food&#47;healthy-eating-tips&#47;iced-tea-hot-tea-and-antioxidants" target="_blank">this article from Prevention<&#47;a>&nbsp;that discusses the health benefits of hot, cold, and bottled teas. &nbsp;They found that a cold brew method for tea (similar to <a title="Cold Brewed Iced Coffee" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;05&#47;cold-brewed-iced-coffee&#47;" target="_blank">cold brew coffee<&#47;a>) actually produces slightly more antioxidants than hot brewed tea. &nbsp;So, as simple as it may sound, I realized that I could drink iced tea and still get all the benefits!</p>
<p>If you are currently using a hot or sun brewed iced tea consider trying this cold brew method. &nbsp;You don't have to heat up any water so it takes less time and energy and it does not have the risk of bad bacteria you may get from the&nbsp;sun brewed method.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;mint_iced_green_tea_pitcher.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1330" src="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;mint_iced_green_tea_pitcher-300x200.jpg" alt="Lemon Mint Iced Green Tea" width="400" height="267" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>You could make a simple green tea, but lemon and mint add additional health benefits not to mention make the tea&nbsp;taste great without any added sweeteners. &nbsp;Lemon has vitamin C which helps the absorption of the health packed tea catechins. &nbsp;In addition lemon is a natural antiseptic, helps the liver detox, and aids in digestions. &nbsp;Mint also aids digestion, and may help with seasonal allergies and help break up congestion due to a cold.</p>
<p>If you don't care about all of the health benefits of this tea, you should still make it so you can&nbsp;add a splash of rum to make a green tea mojito!!</p>
