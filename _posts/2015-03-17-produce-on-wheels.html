<p>In case you don't follow me on Instagram (and you should - <a title="Follow me on Instagram!" href="https:&#47;&#47;instagram.com&#47;kims_kitchen_manual&#47;" target="_blank">kims_kitchen_manual<&#47;a>) here are some photos from my big weekend of preserving. This past weekend I went to an event called Produce on Wheels - With Out Waste and got what seemed like a ton of fresh produce!! &nbsp;From their&nbsp;<a title="Produce On Wheels" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.borderlandsfoodbank.org&#47;powwow.html" target="_blank">website<&#47;a>:&nbsp;<em>Produce On Wheels - With Out Waste (POWWOW) disperses fresh produce to communities at churches, schools and other entities throughout Southern Arizona and the metro Tucson and Phoenix areas. 10 Million lbs. of fresh nutritional rescued produce annually are delivered to agency sites for distribution to supporters. Anyone can donate $10 to shop up to 60lbs. of fresh produce, to share with neighbors, friends, family or someone who's in need.<&#47;em></p>
<p>Since we arrived near the end of the event, they were flexible on the food we took (got more of some items, like grape tomatoes, and didn't get any of others, like squash or lettuce). &nbsp;Since it is "rescued" produce, I knew a majority of it needed to be preserved as soon as possible. &nbsp;I spend my weekend canning, jamming, and roasting! &nbsp;I ended up with almost 20 jars of salsa, 5 jars of tomato jam, 3 jars of pickles, roasted tomato and garlic spread, more than a dozen cups of roasted peppers (red bell and poblano), and I still have some fresh produce left!</p>
<p>Now I need to add this list to my <a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">meal planner<&#47;a> and start using it!</p>
