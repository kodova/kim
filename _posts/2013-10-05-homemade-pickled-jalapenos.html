<p>For my first year of gardening I have picked a couple of simple things to grow: basil, mint, and (easy to grow in Arizona) Jalape&ntilde;os. &nbsp;The jalape&ntilde;o plant has left me with more jalape&ntilde;os than I can use fresh. &nbsp;I love pickled jalape&ntilde;os but have had a hard time finding a store brand that I enjoy, so I am excited to try it myself. &nbsp;Plus, I am trying to have a more homemade pantry and this is a simple recipe to replace a store-bought staple.</p>
<p>If you are new to canning, this is a good place to start as you do not need to submerge the filled jars in water so you need less equipment and time. &nbsp;You simply sterilize the jar in boiling water fill with the peppers and brine and then cap and wait for the lid to "pop". &nbsp;You can check to see if this was successful by pressing the center of the lid; if it presses down and releases back up it is not sealed properly. &nbsp;However, if it does not give then it is sealed. &nbsp;As I am not an expert on canning, please use your senses when you open the jalape&ntilde;os. &nbsp;If they do not look or smell right, then don't eat them!</p>
<p>This is a small batch to fill one pint jar or two half pints. &nbsp;You can easily double the recipe if your family uses a lot of jalape&ntilde;os.</p>
