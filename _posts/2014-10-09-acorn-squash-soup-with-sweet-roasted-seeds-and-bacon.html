<p>Life is busy. &nbsp;It doesn't matter who you are. &nbsp;Being able to make meals in advance is crucial to eating healthy and having home cooked meals. &nbsp;The go to make ahead meals are usually slow cooker dishes, which are often uninspiring, or freezer meals which take a weekend to prepare and freeze and can be limiting as some ingredients just can't be frozen. &nbsp;I love when I can find a dish that can be prepped when you have a few minutes here and there throughout the day or even week.</p>
<p>This soup is one of those. &nbsp;You can prepare the acorn squash (butternut would also work), clean and roast the seeds, wash and cut the kale, and chop the onion all up to 3 or 4 days before! Do those steps whenever you are in the kitchen and have a free minute - when you are brewing coffee or when leftovers are in the microwave. Yes, it requires some planning to make - but so does almost any meal. If you don't like meal planning because you are too busy to follow through with the cooking then try adding one meal a week that you plan in advance. &nbsp;Let me help you come up with perfect recipes and methods to help you fit cooking into your lifestyle. &nbsp;I say that as I balance a baby on one hip, hear my toddler getting up from his nap, and type frantically with one hand - and that is a good day. &nbsp;Everyone has their own busy, but it is about finding time and balance and becoming efficient in the kitchen.</p>
<p>What makes this recipe great is that it has ingredients that are multi-purpose and you utilize the whole squash. &nbsp;The roasted seeds are delicious on a fall salad or on its own as a snack. &nbsp;The seeds are also a great way to hold off a hungry child waiting for dinner (and when they see those yummy seeds on the soup they just might ignore that there is kale in it!). &nbsp;And for those of you with a baby, you can fed them the squash puree! Just thin to desired consistency with water or milk and add nutmeg if you want to expose a new flavor. &nbsp;You can also adjust the way you cook the kale to make another food perfect for baby: steam kale until tender, set aside a portion to puree for baby and then toss the remainder with onions and proceed with the recipe.</p>
<h2>KIM Tips:<&#47;h2><br />
<em>Cutting the Kale<&#47;em>&nbsp;- If you don't mind strings of kale in your soup then just thinly slice the kale leaves. &nbsp;If you don't want to chew your soup then cut the leaves into thin strips and then slice.</p>
<p><em>Knowing when the squash is ready<&#47;em> - You can check the squash for tenderness with a fork, but be aware that some of the juices might come out and caramelize or blacken if checked too early. &nbsp;You can check for doneness by squeezing to see if it is tender - try with an oven mitt or tongs.</p>
<p><em>Checking your seeds<&#47;em> - Check halfway through to see if your oven has uneven hot spots and stir your seeds if some are browning faster than others. &nbsp;Also if the seeds are left out to dry before they are put in the oven, start checking for browning halfway through the cooking time as dry seeds will cook faster.</p>
<p><em>Cooking with kids -&nbsp;<&#47;em>For this recipe, let your child help scoop the cooled squash into the blender and press the start button. &nbsp;If you have a lettuce knife or a knife specifically for kids (like this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B002Q5YH9C&#47;ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Q5YH9C&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20&amp;linkId=IIU6Y2WGW5EXKXCB">Curious Chef 3-Piece Nylon Knife Set<&#47;a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com&#47;e&#47;ir?t=kitchinstrman-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002Q5YH9C" width="1" height="1" border="0" &#47;> ) have them chop the kale.</p>
