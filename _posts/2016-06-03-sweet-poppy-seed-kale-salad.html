<p>This is a "copycat" Sweet Kale Salad that is a kit I often buy&nbsp;from Costco. &nbsp;I rarely crave kale salads, but the sweetness of the dressing and the dried cranberries really balances the bitterness of the kale.</p>
<p>Like a lot of kit salads and salads from restaurants, you have to be mindful of the ingredients and how much dressing is used. &nbsp;If the salad is overdressed, you may consume as many calories as a chicken sandwich.</p>
<p>Making this salad from scratch allows you to control the dressing ingredients which helps makes it healthier. &nbsp;You also control how much dressing is used. &nbsp;If you don't like kale, you may be tempted to use a lot of dressing. &nbsp;Before you do that, try using the tips below. &nbsp;Then slowly add dressing,&nbsp;finding&nbsp;your preference.</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut your kale into small pieces, this will make it easier to chew<&#47;li>
<li>Place your kale in a large bowl or container, sprinkle with salt and a squeeze of lemon juice. &nbsp;"Massage" it - by that I mean grab a handful squeeze a little, release back in the bowl and repeat. &nbsp;You will see the kale become a brighter green and wilt a little. &nbsp;You can store kale like this for about a week! This method will break down the kale making it easier to chew and it will taste a little better.<&#47;li>
<li>If the kale is still tough, let your salad sit for about 5 minutes after dressing it.<&#47;li>
<li>The above tips are for any kale salad. For this specific salad, if you are in a pinch, you can buy a broccoli "slaw" as a substitute for the the matchstick broccoli.<&#47;li>
<li>For the matchstick broccoli, cut the outside of broccoli stem off, then slice into thin boards and slice those again into matchsticks (as you would carrots).<&#47;li>
<li>You can use an optional brussels sprouts if you can find them fresh, which they are not always available (don't use frozen, the texture will be soggy).<&#47;li>
<li>You can make this salad and store it in separate containers in the fridge just like you get with a salad kit (See Image below: kale, cabbage and broccoli - bottom | cranberries and pepitas - middle | salad dressing - top).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
