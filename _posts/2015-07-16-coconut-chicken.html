<p>Chicken tenders are a staple for many families. &nbsp;It seems like no matter if you have a picky eater or not, a favorite meal of&nbsp;kids is breaded chicken. &nbsp;It is one of my go to meals. &nbsp;When I find chicken tenders on sale, I stock up. &nbsp;I make several batches of my regular <a title="Chicken Stock" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2014&#47;11&#47;chicken-stock&#47;">Chicken Strips<&#47;a> and freeze them. &nbsp;Whenever the mood strikes or we don't have a dinner plan, I pull them out of the freezer.</p>
<p>But if you give kids the same thing too frequently, they start to develop bad eating habits. &nbsp;Some will only want to eat the same thing for every meal for day and days.</p>
<p>If you find your family in a situation where <a title="Homemade Chicken Strips" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;08&#47;homemade-chicken-strips&#47;">chicken strips<&#47;a> are regularly demanded and you are sick of it, then switch it up! &nbsp;Try this coconut breaded chicken recipe. &nbsp;It looks nearly the same as your traditional chicken strip recipe, but it adds a new flavor. &nbsp;So if your kids are picky, this is a great way to introduce them subtly to the flavor of coconut. &nbsp;It is sweet, so your kids are guaranteed to love it! &nbsp;In addition, most kids are willing to try any dipping sauce - they are a familiar, smooth texture are frequently sweet. &nbsp;This sauce is a great way to get familiar with mango, which&nbsp;is naturally sweet and a great source of nutrients. &nbsp;Not to mention it is only three ingredients - mango, curry powder and a <a title="Sweet Chili Sauce" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1SoyHHW">sweet chili sauce<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Besides a three ingredient sauce, the&nbsp;recipe for the chicken is simple to make so it can be a quick weeknight meal. &nbsp;The proportions for coconut, panko, and flour are the same&nbsp;- so no&nbsp;need to check the recipe over and over to see how much you need. &nbsp;Bonus - you dirty fewer&nbsp;measuring cups! &nbsp;To learn more about making chicken strips and how to freeze them, see my post on <a title="Homemade Chicken Strips" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;08&#47;homemade-chicken-strips&#47;">Homemade&nbsp;Chicken Strips<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>One quick note about why I prep my chicken the way I do - I have you pound out the chicken into a thin even strip rather than having big round pieces because this allows you to "shallow" fry rather than deep frying the chicken. &nbsp;It is a bit simpler, less to clean up, and less oil wasted (unless you have a deep fryer).</p>
