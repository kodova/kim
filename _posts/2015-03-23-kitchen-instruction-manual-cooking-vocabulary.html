<p>If you are just learning to cook, sometimes what is a simple recipe can be overwhelming because of the terms. &nbsp;How should a vegetable be cut. How do you prepare the&nbsp;meat. How does everything get combined into one dish. &nbsp;I have added a page for you to easily access with all sorts of <a title="Cooking Vocabulary" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;cooking-vocabulary&#47;">cooking vocabulary!<&#47;a>&nbsp; If you are reading a recipe and need to find the definition of a term, on any page you can scroll to the top of the site and find the link for "Cooking Vocabulary".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are looking for a term and it is not on the list, let me know and I will add it.</p>
