<p>Cleaning produce goes beyond the dirt that may be on your fruits and vegetables. &nbsp;If you aren't buying organic then there are pesticides that you want to remove. &nbsp;There can also be harmful bacteria on vegetables, especially those grown in soil like lettuce. &nbsp;Some bacteria can also make the fruit or vegetable spoiler quicker, so if you kill the bad bacteria you may extend the shelf life of your produce and reduce food waste.</p>
<p>Make this a part of your routine when you get home from the grocery store. &nbsp;It may take time to make it a habit and to know exactly how to make the process&nbsp;the most efficient by&nbsp;also prepping them in advance (chop onions, peppers, celery, carrots, etc). &nbsp;The good thing is that you can leave most produce on the counter for a while if you can't do it right when you get home. &nbsp;You can wait until the evening when kids are in bed and you can put on a TV show or some music and spend some time prepping vegetables. &nbsp;You can also prep throughout the day if you are a stay at home mom or trying to accomplish a lot over the weekend. &nbsp;For example, soak a batch of veggies for 10-30 minutes while you fold laundry.</p>
<p>Items like berries, grapes, and cherry tomatoes&nbsp;it is easiest to soak them in a large bowl filled with 1 part vinegar and 4 parts water.</p>
<p>For other produce it is easier to use a spray bottle filled with the mixture below, place the produce on towels and spray completely, let sit for a couple minutes then rinse. &nbsp;The vinegar in this spray has natural anti-bacterial properties, while the lemon juice is a natural astringent.</p>
<p>Wash and prep ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill a large bowl with water and vinegar and &nbsp;place smaller items (like berries) in to soak for up to 30 minutes.<&#47;li>
<li>Spray and place other produce on a cutting board or paper towels for 5 minutes.<&#47;li>
<li>Rinse and pat or air dry all produce.<&#47;li>
<li>Slice and chop your vegetables, store them in separate containers (adding water to items like celery, onions, carrots to prevent from drying out).<&#47;li>
<li>Peel garlic by placing it in a small metal bowl covered with another bowl or lid (I use a baking&nbsp;sheet) and shaking hard for a little bit (<a title="Peeling garlic" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=0d3oc24fD-c" target="_blank">Here<&#47;a> is a video instruction&nbsp;from Saveur). &nbsp;Store in a closed clear container for 2-3 weeks!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
