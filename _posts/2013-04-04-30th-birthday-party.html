<p>As a foodie and a home cook, I love to throw parties. &nbsp;Or at least the idea of it - you get to show off your cooking skills, be with friends or family, and likely drink! &nbsp;However, parties come with a lot of work if you are cooking a huge spread. &nbsp;The last Super Bowl party we had, I spent days preparing the menu, shopping list, and cooking timeline. &nbsp;Then spent a day grocery shopping (had to go to the asian market, the butcher, the regular grocery store, and Bed, Bath and Beyond) and two and a half days in the kitchen. &nbsp;Exhausting! I barely wanted to walk around and talk to guests.</p>
<p>For my husband's 30th birthday, I decided to go a different route and barely cooked. &nbsp;His birthday is in the middle of MLB Spring Training (and we live in Arizona!) so we decided to do a baseball themed party. &nbsp;Sound childish? &nbsp;Maybe a little, but my husband is almost childish about his love for baseball.</p>
<p>I bought a bunch of candy you would find at a concession stand and then spotlighted it with a couple of items that would make anyone forget that you only cooked two things! &nbsp;We had hot dogs and nachos with all of the fixin's including a homemade "condiment" chili for the hot dogs, and pork carnitas for the nachos &nbsp;(recipes to be posted at some later time). &nbsp;Both of these recipes are so easy to make as they are slow cooked in a dutch oven, and can&#47;should be made in advance to help all of the flavors build.</p>
<p>So next time you are looking to through a party but do not want to spend days prepping food, find two larger things that can be prepared in advance and then surround it with other store bought items. &nbsp;Another example is a pizza party; prepare dough and pizza sauce days in advance and then provide half to a full dozen different toppings.</p>
