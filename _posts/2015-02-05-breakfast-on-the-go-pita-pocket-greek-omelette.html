<p>We all have reasons that we need to eat breakfast one handed... Heading out the door to work or school, fussy baby on one hip, multitasking, and for some of you, lets be honest, Facebook. &nbsp;Recently, I had a meeting to get to by 8:45 with both kids. &nbsp;Most of those mornings, my toddler eats a piece of toast or a pop tart in his car seat. &nbsp;I wanted to give him something healthier and more balanced than basically sugar, and I didn't have time to home make a pop tart (but stay tuned, I hope to make some this weekend!). &nbsp;I thought about different ways to make meals one-handed. &nbsp;Sandwiches are usually a good idea, but I wanted something that wouldn't spill out one end as you take a bite from the other. &nbsp;Enter Pita Pockets. What goes well with pita? &nbsp;Greek. &nbsp;So I came up with this greek style egg scramble tucked into a pita pocket.</p>
<p>I will admit, it was not the best idea for my toddler... He decided to eat around the sealed outside edge of the pocket leaving two sides of the pita and an egg mess all over. &nbsp;Thankfully I didn't actually try it out in the car!</p>
<p>This is a quick breakfast, and some make-ahead steps can help it come together while you brew your morning coffee or tea.</p>
<h2>KIM Tips<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li><em><span style="line-height: 16px;">To make ahead: Cut the onions and peppers and store together in an airtight container in the fridge. &nbsp;Shred the zucchini and store separately, also in an airtight container. &nbsp;In the morning you may have to drain liquid from the zucchini. &nbsp;To do so, either place the lid slightly askew to the base and drain, or scoop out the zucchini onto a paper towel and wring out excess liquid over the sink. &nbsp;<&#47;span><&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>If your pita is a little stiff or crumbly, cover with a damp paper towel and heat in the microwave for about 20 seconds.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>The hummus is optional. &nbsp;Use whatever style you have on hand, or even try greek yogurt for more creaminess.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>This is a great option for kids! &nbsp;Its fun, they love things that don't make them too messy but they can still eat with their hands. &nbsp;It also hides the amount of veggies in the eggs. &nbsp;So if your kiddo doesn't like vegetables or they don't like things mixed together, they are less likely to notice. &nbsp;If your little one is more observant, fill the pocket with the egg mixture, then top with cheese (who doesn't like cheese!)<&#47;em><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
