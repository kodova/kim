<p style="text-align: left;">In the past I have attempted to make iced coffee only to be disappointed. &nbsp;Since then I have just avoided attempting it at home, might as well spend the money and get something that tastes good and isn't gritty. &nbsp;Not anymore!<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Coffee is normally brewed at hot temperatures that extract the best flavors and aromas, but it also brings out bitterness. &nbsp;There is a part of our tastebuds that are sensitive to temperature and affect how we perceive flavors. &nbsp;So when coffee is brewed hot it has a bitterness that is appreciated when consumed hot but not warm or cold. &nbsp;At lower temperatures that bitterness stands out and hides the amazing flavors of coffee.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This problem is solved by a method called cold brewing. &nbsp;You get the flavor of hot coffee without the bitterness. &nbsp;Because the water is cold or room temperature it takes longer to extract the flavor from the coffee beans than hot water. &nbsp;So it is best to let the mixture of water and coffee grounds brew overnight. &nbsp;But if you make a large portion it keeps in the fridge so you can brew once and enjoy multiple times!<&#47;p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just started using an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00009OWEV&#47;ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00009OWEV&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20" target="_blank">Eva Solo<&#47;a>&nbsp;for all of my coffee brewing. &nbsp;It brings out flavor in coffee like I never imagined could be possible at home. &nbsp;You could also use a french press, but all you really need is a pitcher and a cheesecloth lined strainer.<&#47;p></p>
