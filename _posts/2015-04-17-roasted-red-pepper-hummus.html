<p>Part of the way I cook, is to focus primarily on using the ingredients I already have on hand because&nbsp;I believe it is the responsible way to use the food that is available to us.&nbsp;Even for this blog&nbsp;- I usually don't go out of my way to make a particular recipe because I think you want to see it. &nbsp;I sit down every week, review what is in my pantry, fridge, and freezer, I <a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">menu plan<&#47;a> for my family, and then choose the best of&nbsp;those recipes to share with you.</p>
<p>Today's recipe for Roasted Red Pepper Hummus came from a need to use all the <a title="Produce On Wheels &ndash; Preserving veggies" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;produce-on-wheels&#47;">red peppers I roasted and froze<&#47;a>&nbsp;a few weeks ago as well as needing to feed my growing toddler who seems to be eating&nbsp;constantly.</p>
<p>I know I recently shared a recipe for <a title="Edamame Hummus" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;edamame-hummus&#47;">edamame hummus<&#47;a>, but hummus&nbsp;is a healthy snack that easy to make and encourages you to eat a snack of vegetables. &nbsp;So it is good to know&nbsp;several different ways to make hummus. &nbsp;Summer is coming, and we all want to eat a little healthier and be more fit for those tank tops and shorts. &nbsp;Many of you&nbsp;will have more mouths to feed&nbsp;while kids are on break from school. &nbsp;However, we all get bored of that hummus with&nbsp;crudit&eacute;s like I have pictured above. &nbsp;For that reason, I made this hummus and hope to find new and creative uses for it to make you excited about hummus again!</p>
<h2><&#47;h2></p>
<h2>New Ideas to use Hummus:<&#47;h2><br />
Spread in celery like you would peanut butter</p>
<p>Cut cucumbers crosswise in 1&#47;2 inch chunks, scoop out some of the center, and place a small spoonful of hummus in the cup</p>
<p>Spread on deli meat (such as turkey), place slices of avocado on one end, roll and slice. &nbsp;Optional: pierce with pretzel sticks to keep together and as a good snack for kids.</p>
<p>Cut tops off of mini bell pepper and stuff with hummus. Optional: garnish with cilantro.</p>
<p>Cut grape tomatoes in half and fill with hummus. Optional: garnish with basil, parsley, or cilantro.</p>
<p>Toss with steamed broccoli in place of cheese sauce.</p>
<p>Make a sandwich with hummus, sliced chicken or turkey, tomatoes, smashed avocado, baby spinach, and feta.</p>
<p>Spread on chicken breasts and bake at 400 for 30-40 minutes (or fish for 10-12 minutes) in a greased baking dish covered with foil.</p>
<p>Make an instant salad dressing by blending hummus, vinegar, and salt and pepper.</p>
<p>I'll be trying some additional ideas and sharing with you throughout the week!</p>

<h3>KIM Tip - Homemade Roasted&nbsp;Peppers<&#47;h3><br />
Since I have so many roasted peppers in my freezer, I don't have a photo step-by-step on how to roast peppers but here is a quick instruction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place peppers over an open flame &nbsp;(outdoor grill, gas stove, broiler, or even blow torch) until&nbsp;charred<&#47;li>
<li>Move the hot pepper to a bowl and cover with foil or plastic wrap for about 10 minutes or until cool enough to handle. &nbsp;Alternatively place in a brown bag.<&#47;li>
<li>Once cooled, remove the charred skin&nbsp;of pepper by peeling with your fingers or with a spoon.<&#47;li>
<li>Pull off the stem and remove any seeds.<&#47;li>
<li>Use in a recipe. &nbsp;To store, place one cup portions in a freezer zip top bag. Spread evenly and freeze flat for easy and organized storage.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
