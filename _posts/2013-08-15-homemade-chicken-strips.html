<p>For those of you new to cooking, I am creating a Basics Instruction Manual series. &nbsp;These posts will go into detail about a very basic recipe. &nbsp;Teaching you core principles about cooking that over time will hopefully allow you to comfortably approach any recipe you see on KIM, in cookbooks and magazines, or anywhere on the web. &nbsp;The posts may get kind of long, but hopefully they are informative and leave you confident to go cook the recipe tonight!</p>
<p>Chicken strips are a great place to start cooking from scratch. &nbsp;They are quick, require few ingredients, and everyone loves chicken strips. &nbsp;Not to mention your favorite dipping sauce will fix almost any problem you have, bad flavor or dry chicken! &nbsp;Cooking chicken tenders can also teach you a lot that you can apply to other areas of cooking.</p>
<p>The first basic thing is learning the difference between parts of a chicken so you can buy the proper cuts. &nbsp;Used here is the tenderloin; it is a portion of the chicken breast underneath between the breast and the ribs. &nbsp;It is smaller than the breast, but similar in shape and just as lean and healthy. &nbsp;And the perfect size for a chicken strip. &nbsp;You could also cut up a chicken breast and use that in place of the tenderloin.</p>
<p>When you cook a steak, there is a reason it is flat and even in thickness, so it cooks evenly. &nbsp;Unfortunately the chicken breast and tender are naturally thicker at one end than the other. &nbsp;If you leave it that way it is likely to be dry at the tip while the other side is either cooked correctly or undercooked. &nbsp;To combat this problem, you should cover the poultry with plastic wrap and flatten it with a meat pounder or even a heavy fry pan (really anything heavy that you can slam down and clean afterward). &nbsp;If you are using a meat pounder, all in one motion work from the middle of the breast and slide outward as you hit the chicken.</p>
<p>The next basic principle is breading. &nbsp;You can bread anything from chicken strips to green beans. &nbsp;You need to set up what is often referred to as a "Breading Station", which consists of 3 shallow pans (I use 9 inch round cake pans) filled with flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. &nbsp;First, pat dry the chicken with a paper towel. &nbsp;Then dredge it in the flour. &nbsp;If I have time, I let the chicken sit after applying the flour as it allows the flour to absorb a little into the chicken which helps the overall breading stick to the chicken. &nbsp;Next is the egg which when you dip the flour covered chicken in it almost creates a paste that the breadcrumbs can then stick to. &nbsp;The important part of the egg is the egg whites which has a majority of the protein from the egg in it. &nbsp;The protein coagulates and helps create a firm layer between the breading and the chicken. &nbsp;So although most egg washes call for whole eggs, feel free to remove a couple yolks or use just egg whites. &nbsp;Lastly is the breading - any variety of coating such as seasoned flour, breadcrumbs, cornflakes, panko, shredded coconut, cheese, or even potato chips if that is your thing! &nbsp;For these chicken strips I like to use a combination of panko and flour.</p>
<p>At this point, you could actually freeze the chicken strips and have a perfect option for dinner when you didn't have time to cook or go to the store that is a lot healthier and tastier than the store bought option. &nbsp;To freeze, place breaded chicken in a single layer on a sheet pan and freeze for about 30 minutes. &nbsp;This allows the outside of the chicken to freeze so they don't stick. &nbsp;Then either place directly in a freezer safe bag or to further prevent the chicken from freezing to each other, place a sheet of parchment paper between each.</p>
<p>Finally, a topic I should spend a whole post explaining the not as bad as you think principles of deep frying (or you could just find Alton Brown's episode of Good Eats on the subject!). &nbsp;If you don't have a deep fryer or a cast iron dutch oven to heat oil in, you can also shallow fry the chicken strips. &nbsp;When you shallow fry you heat a "shallow" amount of oil in a pan - about a 1&#47;4 inch or half the thickness of the chicken. &nbsp;You fry on one side and then flip to fry on the other until golden brown and cooked through.</p>
