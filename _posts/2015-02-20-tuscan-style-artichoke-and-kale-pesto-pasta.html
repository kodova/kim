<p>I recently made a <a title="Winter Kale Pesto" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;winter-kale-pesto&#47;">Kale Pesto<&#47;a> that is perfect when fresh basil is scarce and is amazing&nbsp;in this pasta.</p>
<p>It can be hard to get kids to eat dark green leafy vegetables. &nbsp;Lettuces can be texturally difficult for kids to eat. &nbsp;Green smoothies are a frequent favorites of moms,&nbsp;but kids (or whoever is the picky eater) need to see their greens in order to learn to like them. &nbsp;Using a pesto or chopped parsley in pasta is a great way&nbsp;to start exposure. &nbsp;Next step would be to add chopped greens (gradually getting larger) to the pasta, then remove the pasta all together and do cooked greens or a raw salad.</p>
<p>Pastas are also a great way to introduce new ingredients. &nbsp;Whether to yourself, your picky spouse, or your kids. &nbsp;Pasta with a familiar sauce and protein can mask a more unfamiliar ingredient. &nbsp;Here I added artichoke. &nbsp;I cut it up pretty small so its not as noticeable texturally or bold in flavor. &nbsp;If you think the new ingredient might be rejected completely, then remove some of the dish before adding it or add very little that can be picked out. &nbsp;The last thing you want is a "hangry" little one running around the house and for there to be more leftovers than you can eat by yourself.</p>
<h3><strong>&nbsp;KIM Tips:&nbsp;<&#47;strong><&#47;h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Lemon and Tomatoes add acid to balance the dish. &nbsp;If you don't have either lemon juice or tomatoes, then use more of the other.<&#47;li>
<li>Remove some of the pasta water at the end of cooking, set aside to make the sauce.<&#47;li>
<li>The pasta should be al dente and will finish cooking once added to the other ingredients.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
