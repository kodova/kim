<p>I have continued to use my <a title="Apple Pie Topping" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;apple-pie-topping&#47;">Apple Pie Filling<&#47;a> in many different ways - see the ideas&nbsp;listed in the <a title="Apple Pie Topping" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;apple-pie-topping&#47;">original post<&#47;a>, my&nbsp;<a title="Apple Crisp Waffles" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;apple-crisp-waffles&#47;">Apple Crisp Waffles<&#47;a>, and even an <a title="Apple Whiskey" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;apple-whiskey&#47;">Apple Pie Whiskey<&#47;a> from the scraps.</p>
<p>These delicious bites&nbsp;are wonton wrappers filled with the Apple Pie Topping, sealed together however you like, and dusted with a cinnamon sugar.</p>
<p>What is great about this dessert is that you can make as many or as few as you like! &nbsp;If you keep the apple pie filling and wonton wrappers in the freezer you can have them any day of the week. &nbsp;Just pull them out in the morning and they will be ready for you to put together when you get home from work, or the kids from school, or even if you have last minute guests (you can also thaw the apples by running hot water over the bag, wonton wrappers should thaw pretty quickly at room temp).</p>
