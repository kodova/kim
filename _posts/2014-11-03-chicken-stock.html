<h2>Homemade Chicken Stock<&#47;h2><br />
Chicken Stock is an essential for a well stocked pantry. Besides the obvious chicken soup, you can cook rice or grains in it, make delicious sauces and gravies, stuffings, casseroles or chicken pot pie. Making chicken stock is easy. It makes use of leftovers, and helps improve the flavor of the recipes you use chicken stock in. It is also healthier as you can control the amount of salt that is added (or not added at all) and the addition of Apple Cider Vinegar helps pull out important minerals from the chicken bones into your stock.</p>
<p>This is kind of a vague recipe. I do not believe it is something you should need to go to the grocery store for or use measuring cups and spoons. Instead it should be something you go to your fridge, freezer, and vegetable bowl for. I'll give you tips here to guide you.</p>
<p>A typical chicken stock uses a small 3-4 pound chicken. What I do is over the course of a few months I save the chicken bones from the recipes I use (either cooked or removed from the raw chicken) and store them in a gallon freezer bag. It can be any bone - from the breast, leg, thigh, wings or whole carcass. If you buy a whole chicken and it comes with the innards (liver, neck, etc) those are a flavorful addition as well.</p>
<p>The vegetables can be a mismatch of what you have on hand: carrots, celery, onion, garlic, leeks, parsnips, mushrooms, peppers, potatoes, and even lettuce. Avoid strong tasting or bitter vegetables like brussels sprouts, broccoli and beets. Also avoid using spoiled vegetables - but slightly past their prime is OK (like dried out carrots or bendable celery). Use about 2-3 cups of vegetables for a small chicken.</p>
<h2>How Long Do I Cook Chicken Stock?<&#47;h2><br />
To cook the chicken stock you either need a large stock pot or a pressure cooker. If you have neither of those, you can make a small batch in your largest sauce pot or even use a slow cooker.</p>
<p>In whatever pot you are using place the chicken, vegetables, herbs and any spices (mainly peppercorns), a splash of apple cider vinegar and cover with water by at least one inch. If you are using a stock pot bring the water to a slow boil (where there are large bubbles occurring across the entire surface slowly, unlike the rapid bubbles of a full boil) then reduce to a simmer for 6-8 hours. You can even leave it overnight on the stove or in an oven heated to the lowest possible temperature (about 175) If you are using a pressure cooker you can reduce that cooking time immensely. Bring the pressure cooker to high pressure and maintain for 30 minutes. Then remove from heat and let the pressure release naturally. You can also use the quick release method but you may not get as great depth of flavor.</p>
<h2>Why is my Chicken Stock Oily?<&#47;h2><br />
While cooking, some undesirable fat will come out of the chicken. If you are using a stock pot, skim off any white foam from the top for the first hour or two, after that just check whenever convenient. Then, let it cool in the pot and skim off as much as you can with a spoon. Strain through a sieve (lined with cheese cloth for cleanest results) into storage containers (I reuse soup or take out containers). Refrigerate until fully cooled, then check again for a layer of fat on top. To freeze, you can pour the stock into ice cube trays or muffin tins (I like to use silicon muffin cups) and transfer to zip top bags.</p>
<h2>Why is my Chicken Stock Like Jello?<&#47;h2><br />
When your chicken stock cools, it may become gelatinous. Do not be concerned about this, in fact you can be happy! It is only present in well made, rich, flavorful stock. It is caused by collagen being released from the bones of the chicken and is a healthy nutrient.</p>
<h2>Is There Any Use for the Cooked Vegetables?<&#47;h2><br />
Here is a brilliant use for the vegetables and any pieces of chicken - baby food! If you are starting to introduce meat to your baby this is a great place to start. Homemade meat baby foods can be difficult and off-putting. While making chicken stock, the vegetables have absorbed some of the nutrients from the chicken. Just throw them in a blender and blend to your desired consistency. If you are ready to introduce pasta, you can cook small pasta shapes until they are almost mushy and add them in after you purred the vegetables and you will get something similar to Gerber 3rd foods Chicken Noodles.</p>
