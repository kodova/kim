<p>Ramen noodles are very prevalent in Asian cuisine. &nbsp;Ramen originated in China and became popular in Japan before Thai cuisine adopted it as a dish you can find on the street or markets late-night. &nbsp;You may be able to find fresh Ramen noodles at an asian market, but I just used packaged Top Ramen without the seasoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;These instant noodles are made of wheat flour that are cooked and then dried. &nbsp;So once you get your boiling water it takes just two minutes to cook.</p>
<p>The rest of the dish is also quick. &nbsp;While you are waiting for you water to boil, start prepping your seasonings, vegetables, and meat. &nbsp;One tip to quickly slice your meat, whether pork, chicken or beef, is to put it in the freezer for about 15. &nbsp;It will firm up the outside and allow you to quickly slice and get it extra thin so it cooks fast.</p>
<p>Not only is this dish quick it is also great as leftovers and cheap. &nbsp;Packets of ramen noodles is frequently under a quarter each, you can use any cheap cut of meat, the veggies are reasonably priced, and you are using leftover cilantro stems.</p>
<p>You can use any Asian Green in this recipe:&nbsp;water spinach, choy sum, or bok choy. &nbsp;I love baby bok choy as it is easy to handle and you can use just as much as you need and easily save the rest for another dish. &nbsp;Bok Choy is a member of the cabbage family, so if you are not able to find it or any of the others greens in your market I would suggest using Napa cabbage which is also known as Chinese cabbage.</p>
