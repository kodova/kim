<p>Everyone has a different list of what should be in your pantry at any given time. &nbsp;Sure, there are some ingredients that will be present on each list like olive oil and rice. &nbsp;But if you purchased everything on every list you would have more than you truly need.</p>
<p>So how should you create your own Pantry Essential List? &nbsp;Find out what your family eats on a day to day basis. &nbsp;Create a list of your regular recipes and the ingredients in each of them. &nbsp;How often you cook will determine how many recipes you should choose. Start with your top 5-10 recipes.</p>
<p>When buying ingredients, consider how long the ingredient will last. &nbsp;Did you know that brown rice only lasts 6-8 months even unopened? &nbsp;So if you only use 1 cup every other week don't buy multiple&nbsp;5-pound bags when they are on sale.</p>
<h3>What do I keep in my pantry?<&#47;h3><br />
Oils (olive &amp; vegetable), Vinegars (white, red wine, and cider), Spices (anything &amp; everything!)</p>
<p>Black and&nbsp;Garbanzo beans</p>
<p>Canned Whole Peeled Tomatoes</p>
<p>Rice, Quinoa, and Penne pasta</p>
<p>Whole grain bread, tortillas</p>
<p>Eggs</p>
<p>Vanilla Greek Yogurt, Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Parmesan Cheese</p>
<p>Ground Beef, Chicken Breasts, Chicken Stock, Tilapia, Bacon</p>
<p>Salad Greens, Bell Peppers, Cherry Tomatos, Onion, Garlic, Carrots</p>
<p>Frozen Corn, Peas</p>
<p>Lemons or fresh lemon juice frozen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other Ideas:<&#47;h3><br />
Winter Squash (can last for months)<br />
Tofu (lasts in the fridge for weeks)<br />
Apples (again, can last a long time)<br />
Frozen Fruits &amp; Vegetables<br />
Any meat that can be frozen<br />
Canned Tuna<br />
Nuts (peanuts, cashews, almonds, walnuts), Seeds (pepitas, sunflower), Dried Fruits<br />
Asparagus (When stored in fridge in a cup of water, it can last <em>two weeks!<&#47;em>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
