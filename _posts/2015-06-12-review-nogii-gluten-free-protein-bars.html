<p>I recently received a box of gluten-free goodies! &nbsp;This is a product line of protein bars, protein powder, and paleo bars called NoGii (pronounced noh-jee). &nbsp;They are created by Elisabeth Hasselbeck (of The View fame) who struggled with nutrition and after years of working with physician and nutritionists she was diagnosed with Celiac disease.</p>
<p>The protein bars have no gluten, trans fats, hydrogenated oils, or high fructose corn syrup. What do they have? an ideal balance of protein, fat and carbs. &nbsp;The paleo bars have no dairy, soy, HFCS, trans fat, gluten, or peanuts. &nbsp;They are made from whole foods and have no added ingredients that you can't pronounce! &nbsp;In addition, they have what are called Protein D'Lites which are an amazing little chocolate caramel bars that are loaded with protein, eat like dessert, and are a great portion size.</p>
<p>I am personally not gluten-free, however as Elisabeth Hasselbeck points out in her book even if you do not have celiac or a gluten intolerance there are other benefits for going gluten-free. &nbsp;The one that sticks out to me is mental focus! &nbsp;That is something that I regularly struggle with and am curious if being gluten-free would help me with that. &nbsp;Although I have not chosen to be gluten-free, I have been adopting a healthier diet where I have decreased the amount of gluten I consume.</p>
<p>If I were gluten-free, these bars would definitely be my protein bar of choice! &nbsp;They truly are delicious. &nbsp;Everyone that I had try the bars&nbsp;liked them - including my mom who is mostly gluten-free, my sister who is very athletic, my kids, my husband, and some of his coworkers who are on strict diets.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;NoGii_post_workout.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1189" src="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;NoGii_post_workout.jpeg" alt="NoGii_post_workout" width="800" height="600" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>I enjoyed the Chocolate Mint High Protein bar the best. &nbsp;I noticed that after working out in the evening and eating one of these protein bar (versus a snack of yogurt or cheese) I had a lot more energy and mental focus for the next few hours. &nbsp;So rather than coming home from a workout and plopping on the couch, I felt like cleaning the kitchen and doing work on my computer.</p>
<p>My one complaint is the amount of sugar that is in the bars. &nbsp;Even though they choose better sources of sugar than white processed sugar or high fructose corn syrup, sugar is something that my family tries to keep to a minimum as we have seen how it affects our weight, energy, and food cravings. &nbsp;For this reason, I personally would buy the paleo snack bars which are lower in sugar and from a whole food source.</p>
<p>In addition to the protein bars, I also got to try the quinoa protein powder! &nbsp;It was fantastic. &nbsp;Since it is summer I blended it with watermelon which was a wonderful combination.</p>
<p>Here my son is enjoying the protein d-lite and my daughter is enjoying one of the paleo bars. &nbsp;They also got to try small portions of the protein bars.</p>
