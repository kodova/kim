Normally when I don't have a plan for dinner other than ground beef will be the protein, I make burritos with <a title="Homemade Taco Seasoning" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;homemade-taco-seasoning&#47;">taco seasoned<&#47;a> beef, refried beens and cheese. &nbsp;Simple, easy, and delicious. &nbsp;But also mundane, heavy, and not very healthy. &nbsp;I wanted to find something that would be just as quick as the burrito but wouldn't leave me bloated for the rest of the evening. &nbsp;Oh, and I was determined to use a sweet potato that I forgot I had.</p>
<p>Almost all of the first results for beef + sweet potato were chilis and stews which would take more time than I had. &nbsp;And lately my son doesn't want a big mixture of foods, so I needed something where each ingredient could be put on his plate alone. &nbsp;I then realized that sweet potatoes make awesome fries that my kids would love. &nbsp;I could then top it with the <a title="Homemade Taco Seasoning" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;homemade-taco-seasoning&#47;">taco seasoned<&#47;a> beef (use black beans to make it vegetarian), <a title="Pico de Gallo" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;pico-de-gallo&#47;">pico de gallo<&#47;a> (or just chopped tomatoes), cheese, and avocado&#47;guacamole. &nbsp;This meal was so filling and felt like I was splurging, but I walked away from the table and was able to workout an hour later and not feel sick.</p>
<h2>KIM Tips<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a Mandolin to cut the potatoes if available. &nbsp;If not, be careful to cut them equally so they do not burn.<&#47;li>
<li>Stir the potatoes halfway through the cooking time to avoid burning the bottoms which are getting extra heat from the baking sheet.<&#47;li>
<li>If you want extra crispy fries, lessen cooking time by two minutes and place them under the broiler for a few minutes - watch carefully!<&#47;li>
<li>Use my recipe your own <a title="Homemade Taco Seasoning" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;homemade-taco-seasoning&#47;">taco seasoning<&#47;a>! &nbsp;It is a great place to start and then make it your own adding other spices or changing the proportions.<&#47;li>
<li>Make it vegetarian by either using black beans or tossing mushrooms in a food processor until almost the texture of ground beef.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
This is a meal that can be easily adapted for younger kids too. &nbsp;The key is to keep the ingredients the same, or almost the same, so it is easy on the cook and so you can get them closer and closer to your meal. Below is what our plates looked like. &nbsp;Blue is my almost 3 year old, pink is my 1 year old, and brown is the adult version.&nbsp;I removed some cooked, seasoned, beef before I added salt (my homemade taco seasoning is saltless so I was still able to give her more than plain beef). &nbsp;The cheese is different, but it came from the same spot in the fridge so it didn't add too much effort (you could also sprinkle cheese on the beef). &nbsp;I used <a title="Pico de Gallo" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;pico-de-gallo&#47;">pico de gallo<&#47;a> on my plate, only because it was prepared, otherwise I would have just used chopped tomatoes. &nbsp;I gave a small amount of ranch dip to my 3 year old because if he is at all hesitant about something he will almost always try it if he can dip it in something. Oh, and they don't have avocado because I plain old forgot to give them some.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Would your kids eat this meal? &nbsp;What might you change to make it more appealing to them?<&#47;p><br />
