<p>Grain bowls are "all the rage" right now. &nbsp;They are a healthy and very adaptable way to eat healthy. &nbsp;It is like an omelette, once you have the technique you can create whatever you pleases you most or with whatever you have in your fridge.</p>
<p>I will admit that I am proud I was able to create such a healthy meal while <a title="KIM&rsquo;s Pantry Clean Out" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;kims-pantry-clean-out&#47;">cleaning out my pantry<&#47;a>! &nbsp;First I made this awesome <a title="Tahini Dressing" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;tahini-dressing&#47;">Tahini Dressing<&#47;a>&nbsp;from the leftover bit at the bottom of the jar. Then, I had been storing dried chickpeas for a few weeks, just waiting for the "right" moment&nbsp;to try to cook them for the first time. &nbsp;It was super simple (read: hands off!) and it was awesome&nbsp;to not feel grossed out by the slimy liquid in the cans. &nbsp;The chickpeas also did not fall apart as I stir&nbsp;fried them like the canned versions often do for me. &nbsp;But do not feel like you can't make this dish if you only have canned chickpeas.</p>
<p>Proud mommy moment: My son grabbed a chair and ate them directly off the pan while they cooled. &nbsp;He would rather eat chickpeas than goldfish! &nbsp;Oh, and he also insisted on taking his own pictures of our food :) &nbsp;Foodie or Photographer?</p>

<p>KIM Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a great way to use any leftover grains you might have: quinoa, brown rice, farro, barley, etc.<&#47;li>
<li>If you want this to be just a grain bowl, add an extra 1 1&#47;2 cups or so of cooked grains.<&#47;li>
<li>Depending on how much dressing you like, you may want to toss the salad greens in additional dressing.<&#47;li>
<li>Chickpeas and Garbanzo beans are the same thing!<&#47;li>
<li>Tofu preparation: buy firm&#47;extra firm tofu, slice into 8 slabs, press under cutting board topped with heavy items for 30 minutes. &nbsp;Then dice into 1&#47;2 inch cubes.&nbsp;If you pre sear the tofu or use oven baked tofu then add after the vegetables are soft.<&#47;li>
<li>Tofu is a great pantry item. &nbsp;It is cheap and stays good in the fridge for weeks. &nbsp;So if you don't have a fresh protein or forgot to thaw one from the freezer, then you can easily use tofu!<&#47;li>
<li>If you don't like tofu, you can easily substitute cooked chicken breast for the tofu.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since making some recipes from the Salad Samurai I have learned to love tofu!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
