Tacos.</p>
<p>Yum.</p>
<p>These tacos are made from the deliciously simple 2 ingredient&nbsp;<a title="Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;slow-cooker-mexican-chicken&#47;">Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken<&#47;a>, some&nbsp;<a title="Pico de Gallo" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;pico-de-gallo&#47;">Pico de Gallo<&#47;a>,&nbsp;<a title="Homemade Pickled Jalape&ntilde;os" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;10&#47;homemade-pickled-jalapenos&#47;">Pickled Jalapenos<&#47;a>, and whatever your other favorite toppings are - jack cheese, avocado, lime wedges.</p>
<p>And don't think that babies can't eat tacos! She devoured this meal quicker than I have seen her eat anything in the last few weeks. &nbsp;I basically just cut up every part of my taco (on the right) for her, and subbed the pico for cut up cherry tomatoes.<br />

<p>KIM Taco Tips</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 16px;">To warm corn tortillas, wet a paper towel, then wrap it around 5-6 tortillas and microwave for about 15 seconds. &nbsp;You can also heat them individually over a gas grill until slightly charred.<&#47;span><&#47;li>
<li>Set up a taco bar with whatever ingredients you have available and let your kiddos put together their own dinner. &nbsp;If you are trying to get them to try something new, let them put together all but one taco and you put together the last with ingredients they like and then ONE new ingredient you are trying to get them to eat.<&#47;li>
<li>To help with portion control, use a measuring cup or spoon for the chicken (1&#47;4 cup) and cheese (1 tablespoon) and other non-veggies or high calorie items.<&#47;li>
<li>You don't need a recipe for tacos! (just the protein, in this case my <a title="Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;slow-cooker-mexican-chicken&#47;">Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken<&#47;a>)&nbsp;So I don't have one here. &nbsp;Take a bite... if its not perfect, add more ingredients.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
