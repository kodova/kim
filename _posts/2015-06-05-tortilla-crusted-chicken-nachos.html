<p>Tortilla crusted chicken is an idea that has been around for a while and is on a lot of blogs. &nbsp;But I still want to share my version with you because its awesome *wink*.</p>
<p>Tortilla crusted chicken is simple, cheap, and kids&nbsp;love it. &nbsp;However, I find it a little one-note and&nbsp;salty. &nbsp;When a meal disappoints me, I always think&nbsp;about what I can change to bring it to the next level. &nbsp;I had a couple ideas involving salsa or enchilada sauce, then I realized my favorite thing to do with tortilla chips is.... Nachos! So why not smother it with cheese, black beans, <a title="Homemade Pickled Jalape&ntilde;os" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;10&#47;homemade-pickled-jalapenos&#47;">(homemade) pickled jalape&ntilde;os<&#47;a>, salsa, avocado and whatever your favorite nacho toppings are.</p>
<p>To make this a dish that your kids love even more- make it&nbsp;a build your own! After baking the chicken, let each family member top their chicken with whatever variety they like. &nbsp;If you aren't serving a side of vegetables be sure to have diced tomatoes, onions, or whatever vegetable they might be willing to scoop on.</p>
<p>Not only is this a fun dinner, I think tortilla crusted chicken&nbsp;is an important recipe for everyone to know. &nbsp;Why is it <em>important<&#47;em>? Well, first because any recipe that your kids will eat is important! &nbsp;Second, tortilla chips are something that many of us&nbsp;regularly eat so we often have them in our pantry, so this a perfect go-to meal when you don't have anything planned. &nbsp;Third,&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;probably do not polish off the bag, and those broken bits at the bottom often get tossed in the trash with the plastic. &nbsp;If you know me or have been following me (<a title="Follow me on Pinterest" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.pinterest.com&#47;kitchenmanual&#47;" target="_blank">pinterest<&#47;a>, <a title="Follow me on Instagram" href="https:&#47;&#47;instagram.com&#47;kims_kitchen_manual&#47;" target="_blank">instagram<&#47;a>, and <a title="Follow me on Twitter" href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;KitchenManual" target="_blank">twitter<&#47;a>), I have been making a significant effort to not waste food and to cook "root to stalk" since I did a <a title="Pantry Clean Out &ndash; Lessons Learned" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;pantry-clean-out-lessons-learned&#47;">pantry clean out<&#47;a>&nbsp;and assessment of my own food waste. &nbsp;This is a great recipe to make sure I'm not wasting even little scraps or crumbs of food. &nbsp;This method uses those chip crumbs that aren't capable of dipping! It&nbsp;also works with stale chips (baking refreshes them a little), so if you find a bag of stale chips in the back of your cabinet you can use those too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<p>You can use whatever chicken you prefer or have available (you can mix them up too!):</p>
<ul>
<li>Chicken tenders: Cover with plastic wrap or put in a zip top bag, use a mallet or heavy pan to pound out evenly.<&#47;li>
<li>Chicken breast: If really thick, butterfly or slice the breast in half so you have two thin pieces. Cut again into smaller strips about 1 1&#47;2 inches wide. &nbsp;As with the tenders, pound out (if necessary) to reach about 1&#47;2 inch even thickness.<&#47;li>
<li>Chicken thighs: Remove skin and bone and lay flat, again pounding out if you have any uneven spots. &nbsp;Cut in half to create a more "chicken strip" shape.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Although it might be a habit to salt your chicken, I would skip this step or salt lightly because tortilla chips are very salty.</p>
<p>The method to prepare the chicken is just like a typical breaded chicken for chicken strips or chicken parmesan. &nbsp;If you are unfamiliar with the process, read more about it on my <a title="Homemade Chicken Strips" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;08&#47;homemade-chicken-strips&#47;">Chicken Tenders<&#47;a> post.</p>
<p>If you don't have enough chip crumbs either freeze&nbsp;them in a zip-top bag adding to it whenever you have crumbs or try a substitute like another chip variety or even breadcrumbs&#47;panko.</p>
<p>If you are using a shredded cheese rather than a nacho cheese sauce, sprinkle on the cheese then melt under the broiler as the microwave may make the chip crust soggy.</p>
<p>To reheat any leftovers place on a sheet pan and broil until heated through and crispy.</p>
