<p>Some days I struggle to find a use for some left over food (a big part of my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">meal planning<&#47;a>), other days ideas fall into my lap.</p>
<p>A couple weekends ago the Grandparents took the kids away for 4 days! We had just bought two gallons of milk and opened one. &nbsp;The likelihood that I would drink the leftover milk before it went bad was very slim but it wasn't on my mind that I needed to find a way to use it up. &nbsp;Instead, I was searching for some freezer and slow cooker meals that I could put together while the kids were out of town to help on those busy days that I don't have a lot of time to cook. &nbsp;During that search, the idea of homemade yogurt in the slow cooker just fell in my lap. &nbsp;Best of all, it uses half gallon of milk that I needed to use up!</p>
<p><strong>KIM Tip<&#47;strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is important to use plain yogurt with no sugar added, otherwise it will not culture properly<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
The yogurt was pretty amazing! &nbsp;However I don't typically&nbsp;like honey yogurt, so next time I will use organic&nbsp;raw cane sugar and vanilla. &nbsp;I will update with instructions and how it turns out!</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention you can freeze yogurt? So you can make a double batch and freeze half for another week!</p>
