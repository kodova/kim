<h1>Why a "Pantry Clean Out"?<&#47;h1><br />
We live in a world&nbsp;of excess. &nbsp;But in between excess, there are plenty of people who are living with not enough. &nbsp;When we spend&nbsp;too much we don't have as many&nbsp;resources availably to be able to give to others. &nbsp;Although it is for me, this doesn't need to be a religious thing. &nbsp;We all should feel the need to take care of our neighbors. &nbsp;According to Feeding America 1 in 6 people are hungry, so whether you know it or not you have a "neighbor" that is hungry.</p>
<p>It is also more time consuming for us if we have too much stuff (there is a whole minimalist movement derived from this idea, see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.becomingminimalist.com&#47;">Becoming Minimalist<&#47;a> for example). &nbsp;How long would&nbsp;it take you to clean and organize your pantry right now? &nbsp;Now how long do you think it would it take if you only had a week or two's worth of food? &nbsp;How about those nights when you don't know what to make for dinner - you shuffle&nbsp;through all the cans and pasta boxes and say you have nothing to eat. &nbsp;First, how much food do you really have? And then how much time do you spend thinking about what to make for dinner and still end up spending more money getting take-out? 20-30 minutes?</p>
<p>I decided I was spending too much time trying to figure out what we were going to eat and going to the grocery store for dinner that night or just shopping the deals. &nbsp;I realized that if I spent less on groceries I would be able to donate more money to help other families in need. &nbsp;Not only that, but if I had more time in my week I could take that&nbsp;time to <em>serve<&#47;em> our community.</p>
<h1>What Did I Learn?<&#47;h1><br />
At first I was making meals&nbsp;we regularly eat and using items from my pantry that I regularly buy. &nbsp;I realized that was not the approach I should take to truly clean out my pantry.&nbsp;&nbsp;I then started to pick ingredients that I don't regularly use and found recipes I had not tried. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it was a little time consuming to find recipes that didn't require going to the grocery store.</p>
<p>I was surprised - after two weeks the only items I purchased were one big thing of salad greens, two gallons of milk, and I'll be honest - Beer. &nbsp;I still have enough food to feed us for at least two more weeks!</p>
<h3>The biggest lesson learned: Menu Plan!<&#47;h3><br />
I shouldn't need to set aside a week or two to clear out my pantry. &nbsp;What I should be doing is keeping an Inventory of what is in my Pantry and my Freezer and then picking a few items each week to use in a recipe. &nbsp;Combine that with what is in season and on sale at the grocery store.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be hard to do if all you are doing is writing down one dinner for each night of the week on a chalk board or piece of paper. &nbsp;Even harder if you regularly try to figure out what you are making for dinner the day of.</p>
<p>I have created a menu planning system and worksheets to fill out each week. &nbsp;I will be presenting the Menu Planner at Cornerstone Church's "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;csfaithandfood.com&#47;">Faith&nbsp;and Food<&#47;a>" Monthly meeting on March 9th, 2015. &nbsp;If you are not able to attend, check back next week for a post describing my menu planning system and the opportunity to download a copy of my worksheet for FREE!</p>
