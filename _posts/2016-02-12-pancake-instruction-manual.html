<p>Pancakes are something that everyone should know how to make. You can make a simple pancake topped with butter and maple syrup or complicate it with fancy toppings.</p>
<p>To make pancakes you simply mix a bunch of dry ingredients in one bowl and then a bunch of wet ingredients in another, then gently mix them together. &nbsp;But there are things that can go wrong.</p>
<p>To get started you need to know that pancakes have a leavening agent so they rise, giving them a light fluffy texture. &nbsp;Dense pancakes are a sign that something went wrong with your baking soda. &nbsp;Over time your baking soda can loose its effectiveness. &nbsp;If you aren't sure how long your baking soda had been in your pantry then do this quick test: &nbsp;Take a small amount (about 1&#47;4 teaspoon or so) of baking soda in a small bowl and add a couple drops of vinegar to it. &nbsp;You should see&nbsp;it foam&nbsp;vigorously.</p>
<p>If your baking soda is good and you still have dense pancakes then look over your other ingredients to see if you have an acid. &nbsp;Buttermilk is a common acid used in pancakes, so if you thought you could do a straight substitute of regular milk in your recipe think again! But there are some simple ways to add acid to your pancakes. &nbsp;You can add a little bit of lemon juice to your milk and let it sit on the counter for a few minutes, you can&nbsp;add some yogurt to your milk, or whisk cultured buttermilk in with your dry ingredients.</p>
<p>Many people suggest making pancake batter ahead of time that way you can make pancakes throughout the week. &nbsp;This works to some extent, however as soon as the baking soda is activated, it starts to loose its power. &nbsp;So&nbsp;for best results,&nbsp;use the batter immediately.</p>
<p>If you want to have an easier way of making pancakes then look at the recipe for an instant pancake mix. &nbsp;It will yield 3 batches of pancakes (or if you like to make small batches of pancakes it can easily be halved). &nbsp;All you need to do is scoop out two cups of the mix, whisk your buttermilk, eggs, and butter&#47;oil and fold the two together.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">UPDATE:<&#47;span> I have changed this recipe to use Whole Wheat Flour. &nbsp;Using whole wheat flour is not just about health in this recipe. &nbsp;Whole wheat flour actually makes fluffier pancakes and it isn't as important to not over mix your ingredients. &nbsp;It is a little, just a little, earthier...but I personally love that and think it pairs deliciously with the syrup! And having a more fool proof and healthier&nbsp;recipe is so worth it!</p>
<h2>KIM Tips for perfect pancakes<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Mix your dry and wet ingredients separately. &nbsp;Whisk your dry ingredients so the baking soda and powder are evenly distributed. &nbsp;Mix the wet ingredients in a separate bowl so you don't over mix your batter.<&#47;li>
<li>Let me repeat that again: <strong>Don't over mix your batter<&#47;strong>, lumps of flour are more than acceptable. &nbsp;Mix just enough to moisten your dry ingredients.<&#47;li>
<li>Make sure your baking soda is active or you will get flat pancakes (see instructions in the article above).<&#47;li>
<li>Use a griddle or a pan with a heavy bottom to prevent burning your pancakes.<&#47;li>
<li>Wait until bubbles in the batter form AND pop, leaving holes that stay open (if they fill back up then your batter hasn't been cooked enough).<&#47;li>
<li>Flip your pancakes once! &nbsp;If you aren't sure that they are the golden color you desire, then quickly peak underneath and flip only when they are ready.<&#47;li>
<li>Don't press down on your pancakes after you have flipped them.<&#47;li><br />
