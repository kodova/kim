<p>Life is getting busy for my little family. &nbsp;I am finding myself running around from one thing to the next. I&nbsp;am trying to figure out how to have homemade lunches&nbsp;that are&nbsp;vegetable centered, rather than sandwiches or quesadillas everyday.</p>
<p>This salad comes together in just minutes and requires little prep work - just a minute or two of slicing and a couple minutes to gather and mix up the ingredients for the sauce.</p>
<p>If you know you are going to serve this cold, you can skip the cooking&nbsp;of the chicken and save more time! Just leave out the additional oil (and garlic if you don't like raw garlic).</p>
<p>If you have little ones that don't like broccoli because of the taste or texture, this is a great introduction. &nbsp;It doesn't look like broccoli and the taste is very mild. &nbsp;Oh, and did I mention it is a nut butter sauce?! &nbsp;If kids could have their vegetables slathered in anything it would probably be peanut butter or ranch, am I right?</p>
<p>You can store this salad for 3-5 days. &nbsp;So I encourage you to make it the night before when you have little distractions or temptations that will make you change your mind!</p>
