<p>On any given Friday night, the smell of buffalo sauce wafts through our house. &nbsp;There are so many recipes out there for buffalo wings. &nbsp;Oven-baked, deep fried, pan fried, brined, marinated. &nbsp;I tried so many different methods before I settled on one that I will stick forever because they are just as good as any&nbsp;restaurant wings. &nbsp;In fact, they are more consistently delicious than the brewery that has some of the best wings in town! &nbsp;For that reason it is worth the effort of these wings. &nbsp;Really it is more time consuming than effortful.</p>
<p>First, the wings are brined in a simple solution of water, salt and baking soda for an hour. &nbsp;Then they are sous vide for another hour. &nbsp;Don't have a fancy machine? &nbsp;Neither do I. &nbsp;I set up a large pot of water on the stove, bring it to just above the cooking temperature, then add the wings. &nbsp;Before I heat the water, I put the chicken in gallon zip top bags and dip them in the pot of water until the top is just above the water and close it. &nbsp;This helps remove all of the air from the bag and essentially vacuum seals it without smooshing the chicken. &nbsp;Why sous vide it? Same reason you sous vide anything. &nbsp;It cooks the meat perfectly without it drying out or getting tough.</p>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked it is time to crisp up the outside. &nbsp;I use a deep fryer, but you can also use a cast iron skillet with a half inch of oil and fry on each side for about 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p>Then the most satisfying part is tossing the wings in the sauce and watching them become a that familiar glorious orange color.</p>
