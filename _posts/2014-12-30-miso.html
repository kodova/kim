<p>The new year is here and so is the desire in most of us to rethink our eating habits. &nbsp;Weather you are thinking about starting a diet or have the mindset of just eating healthier, miso is something you should have in your pantry. &nbsp;It adds great flavor, stays for a long time in the fridge and there are more and more recipes that use it than just the traditional Miso Soup.</p>
<h2>What is Miso and Why Should I Use it?<&#47;h2><br />
Miso is a soybean paste that has been fermented for anywhere from 3 months to 3 years. &nbsp;It is a staple in Japanese cooking, traditionally used to season soups. But it is now being used in a wider variety of modern cooking providing salty, sweet, earthy, fruity, and umami (savory) flavor depending on the type of miso used. &nbsp;There are many different types of miso, but they are mostly categorized by appearance and flavor profile. &nbsp;The most common are referred to as red, white, and brown miso. &nbsp;The flavor of a particular miso is determined by the fermentation temperature and duration, salt content, and other ingredients that might be added such as rice or barley.</p>
<h4>Where can you find miso?<&#47;h4><br />
Because of its growing popularity many grocery stores are starting to carry miso. &nbsp;If its not at your local store, check a health foods store (such as whole foods) or an Asian Market. &nbsp;I have typically found it in the refrigerated section near the tofu.</p>
<h3>Health Benefits of Miso<&#47;h3><br />
Like many other fermented foods, one health benefit of miso is its ability to improve digestion and immunity. It stimulates the secretion of digestive fluids in the stomach and restores beneficial probiotics to the intestines.<br />
Miso is also a complete protein, provides energy through vitamin B, is high in fiber, and has disease fighting properties. However, it may have a large amount of sodium which may be a concern to some.</p>
<h3>How to Use Miso<&#47;h3><br />
There are many ways to us miso. Use miso in soups, as seasoning in sauces, and in dips or spreads. Check out the list below for recipes including miso. &nbsp;Because miso is fermented it will stay a long time (about a year) in the fridge because other bacterias cannot overtake the one used during fermentation.</p>
