<p>The recipe title may sound intimidating - Salsa Verde and Scarlet Onions, how much time is this going to take! Truth is, only about 15 minutes. &nbsp;It is a great introduction to <a title="Salsa Verde" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;salsa-verde&#47;">Salsa Verde<&#47;a> (learn more about salsa verde <a title="Salsa Verde" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;salsa-verde&#47;">here<&#47;a>) as it doesn't require a food processor and the ingredient list is short: only two chopped herbs, some oil and vinegar, and a portion of the Scarlet Onions, which are just quick pickled red onions that you already are making to top the asparagus with.</p>
<p><strong>TOOL TIP:<&#47;strong> &nbsp;This recipe calls for a large strip of orange zest that you need to slice into small strips. &nbsp;You can do this with a paring knife or vegetable peeler. &nbsp;You may have a standard citrus zester or grater, but I would recommend also having a "bartenders" zester (<a title="OXO Lemon Zestor" href=""http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00004OCJO&#47;ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004OCJO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20" target="_blank">like this one<&#47;a>). &nbsp;I like to use this zester for speed and appearance. &nbsp;In fact this is the only zester I use for citrus. &nbsp;Depending on your pressure you can get different types of zest. &nbsp;If you run it quick and lightly over the peel you will get small pieces of zest that is commonly used. &nbsp;For this recipe, use some pressure and you get long strands of zest like you can see in the picture above. &nbsp;The zester does a great job at leaving behind the rind and it gives you perfectly even strips that are smaller than you could get without a lot of practice or&nbsp;meticulous&nbsp;work. &nbsp; The OXO zester also has a notch took&#47;channel knife that can be used for making fancy garnishes (we will get to that in another post!)</p>
