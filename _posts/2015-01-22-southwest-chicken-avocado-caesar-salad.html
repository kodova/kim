<p>The fun isn't over with my <a title="Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;slow-cooker-mexican-chicken&#47;">Slow Cooker Mexican Chicken<&#47;a>! &nbsp;This is a southwestern inspired salad with a creamy avocado dressing that is similar to a caesar dressing, but healthier! &nbsp;The avocado is blended up to create a creamy texture that replaces the mayo found in traditional caesar dressing.</p>
<p>I eat half an avocado nearly every day and they are a staple in my house to feed the little ones with. &nbsp;They are nutrient dense with more than 20 vitamins and minerals, have healthy fats, and they are naturally sodium and cholesterol free! &nbsp;It is soft and creamy and a great first food for babies. &nbsp;Green foods scare a lot of kids, but who doesn't like avocados? &nbsp;So get them used to eating green with avocado and then move on to something a little more flavorful.</p>
<p>Most days I eat smashed avocado on toast, topped with eggs and hot sauce. &nbsp;That breakfast is like pizza for me, I can eat it almost every day and not get sick of it. &nbsp;But I like to cook new recipes too much to actually eat the same thing every day!</p>
<p>If you are trying to put together a salad in under 5 minutes, then put together the dressing and top it with <a title="Pico de Gallo" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;pico-de-gallo&#47;">pico de gallo<&#47;a>&nbsp;and any leftover tortilla strips from the <a title="Tortilla Soup" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;tortilla-soup&#47;">tortilla soup<&#47;a>. &nbsp;If you have another 5 minutes, then create a heartier topping with corn and black beans (instructions below).</p>
