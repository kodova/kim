<p>I made a&nbsp;<a title="Pesto Chicken Salad" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;pesto-chicken-salad&#47;">pesto chicken salad<&#47;a> this week, and I realized I have only shared my <a title="Winter Kale Pesto" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;winter-kale-pesto&#47;">Kale Pesto<&#47;a> recipe with. &nbsp;It also reminded me of&nbsp;the&nbsp;short presentation I gave recently about depression and how the food we eat can affect how our body and brain work. &nbsp;Some foods negatively effect our bodies while&nbsp;others, like the Omegas in this pesto, have a positive effect. &nbsp;Here is a little of what I talked about in that presentation:</p>
<p>The parts of the brain responsible for regulating mood, thinking, sleep, appetite and behavior don't function normally in people who are depressed. In addition, important neurotransmitters-chemicals that brain cells use to communicate appear to be out of balance.</p>
<p>In order for those brain cells and neurotransmitters to function properly, your body needs phospholipids which are produced by&nbsp;Essential&nbsp;Fatty Acids - found in&nbsp;the&nbsp; form of Omega-3 &amp; Omega-6.&nbsp; In addition, studies have show that increasing your intake of foods high in omega fatty acids decreases inflammation, which has been linked to depression.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&rsquo;t depressed,&nbsp;Omega 3s have many other benefits such as being anti-inflammatory - which causes a number of problems and diseases -&nbsp; improved heart health, and immunity. &nbsp;Fish oil supplements can also help with post-workout soreness.</p>
<p>Nutritious food can help improve our mood and make us feel physically better. &nbsp;<b>When we feel healthy, are happy, and stress is minimal that is when we are in the best position to<&#47;b> <b>flourish<&#47;b>&hellip; &nbsp;So my goal for you is to start increasing your intake of omega-3s.</p>
<p>Pesto is a great way to eat sources of Omega-3s because its ingredient are good to excellent sources of Omega-3s:<em><strong><strong>&nbsp;<&#47;strong><&#47;strong><&#47;em>Basil (<em>good source of omega-3s<&#47;em>),&nbsp;Walnuts (<em>excellent source of omega-3s<&#47;em>),&nbsp;Flax Oil (also an <em>excellent source of omega-3s<&#47;em>, alternatively use &frac14; cup more olive oil)</p>
<p>NOTE: If you use flax oil, do not heat pesto to a high temperature. &nbsp;Rather toss cooked vegetables, meat, or pasta in pesto.</p>
