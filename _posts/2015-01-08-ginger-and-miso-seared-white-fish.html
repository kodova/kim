<p>I'm always looking for new ways to get more fish into our meals. &nbsp;Most white fish are reasonably priced, simple to use, don't have strong fishy flavor and can really take on any flavor you want. &nbsp;This recipe is sweet (from the white miso) with just a little spice from&nbsp;sriracha, sambal oelek, or whatever your favorite red chili sauce is&nbsp;(I kept it tame using just one tablespoon of sambal oelek because I was feeding my little ones, but&nbsp;you can kick up the spice if you like).</p>
<p>The ingredients whisk into a paste quickly, but if needed you can put it together in advance. &nbsp;However the fish should not marinate for more than 45 minutes. &nbsp;After that, the fish will start to break down and loose its texture. &nbsp;You can skip the marinade all together if you are short on time, just be sure to set some aside to before you put the fish in it so you can have a dip.</p>
