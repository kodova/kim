Before spreading the beans over the roll, I simply mixed in the leftover chicken. &nbsp;Rather than going out to buy mexican queso, I used cheddar and jack cheese. &nbsp;To serve, I topped it with the <a title="Pico de Gallo" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;pico-de-gallo&#47;">Pico de Gallo<&#47;a> I made for the tacos. &nbsp;If you didn't make the pico, you can top with any salsa &nbsp;(a great use for any leftover salsa from the original chicken recipe) or even pull out those hot sauce packets from your favorite fast food restaurant that you have been hoarding!</p>
<p>Molletes traditionally are served on rolls called bolillo. &nbsp;It is similar to a french baguette, but shorter and a thinner crust. &nbsp;Here in Arizona you can find this roll in almost all grocery stores. &nbsp;Often it is baked fresh in the bakery where you can buy individual rolls. &nbsp;If bolillo or another mexican bread like telera (which is more circular than oval and not as crusty) are not available, look for a similar bread that is savory and crusty on the outside. &nbsp;Kaiser or ciabatta are great options. &nbsp;Really, any sandwich roll would work. &nbsp;Just flip it upside down and toast the outside in addition to the middle to help give the sandwich structure and texture.</p>
