<p>Yesterday I wrote&nbsp;an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2016&#47;02&#47;potato-instruction-manual&#47;">Instruction Manual on Potatoes<&#47;a>. And what goes better with potatoes than Ketchup? &nbsp;Homemade Ketchup!!!</p>
<p>As we all strive to eat healthier &amp; cleaner, simple basics like ketchup may be overlooked. &nbsp;Sometimes a good way to judge food is to ask would our (great)Grandparent eat that? &nbsp;They grew up in an era where processed food was minimal. &nbsp;But I bet our Grandparents ate ketchup - Heinz&nbsp;started producing ketchup in the late 1800s! &nbsp;It has been around for a looooong time. &nbsp;&nbsp;But what hasn't been around that long is High Fructose Corn Syrup, which is in almost every ketchup bottle on the shelf today.</p>
<p>Lets take ketchup back from the manufacturers and start making it ourselves.</p>
<p>Just like anything else you make from scratch, you can adjust the recipe and make it your own. &nbsp;The one thing that will make the most impact on your ketchup is the amount of vinegar. &nbsp;My family likes it on the tangy side, so we add a little more vinegar. &nbsp;Other changes you could make: if&nbsp;you like it sweeter, add more sugar. &nbsp;If you are eating clean&#47;processed free&#47;whole foods, you may swap the brown sugar for raw honey. &nbsp;You can also play with the amount of spices and find the perfect fit for your taste buds!</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>You could store the ketchup in a glass mason jar, or for easy access get a plastic <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1LFwD0P" target="_blank">squeeze bottle<&#47;a>!<&#47;li>
<li>Cooking is optional! &nbsp;You can make this ketchup in a blender. However, the flavor of the spices will come through more if you let it simmer on the stove.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
