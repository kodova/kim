<p>Taco Seasoning mix is a staple in a lot of homes. &nbsp;It is an easy way to season beef or chicken when you need a quick meal. &nbsp;It does not take much effort to mix a bunch of spices, so please add this recipe to your pantry! &nbsp;It provides enough seasoning for about 3 pounds of meat so you don't need to make it every time you are making tacos!</p>
<p>NOTE: Most packets and other recipes on the internet call for a lot of salt. &nbsp;I prefer to control my salt from meal to meal so I have omitted it here.</p>
