This week I have had two kids with double ear infections(!) and every time we were out I just wanted to stop at a deli and get a sandwich rather than prepare lunch at home. I have been trying to keep my healthy eating goals and making more foods at home from scratch. So instead of stopping at the deli, I grabbed some ingredient while we were at the grocery store to make a Pastrami Reuben at home. I'll also be experimenting with making a Pastrami Reuben Salad that I'll share later this week!</p>
<p>Russian dressing is a must on a reuben sandwich, and a condiment that is easy to make. Dressings, marinades, and sauces are a great place to start cooking from scratch. Many don't require any real cooking, just whisking some ingredients in a bowl.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with Russian Dressing, it is very similar to Thousand Island. Russian dressing might have a bit more spice (from horseradish, for example) while Thousand Island usually has some sweet pickle relish and&#47;or hard boiled egg in it.</p>
<p>Use this dressing on a Reuben Sandwich. &nbsp;My favorite version is with Pastrami, Swiss Cheese, Sauerkraut, and Russian Dressing all on toasted Sour Dough. &nbsp;Check back soon for that salad!</p>
