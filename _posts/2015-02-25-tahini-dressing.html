<p>I have challenged myself to <a title="KIM&rsquo;s Pantry Clean Out" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;kims-pantry-clean-out&#47;">clean out my pantry<&#47;a>. &nbsp;Beyond just using the ingredients I have, I am trying not to waste anything. &nbsp;It is even a trend in the food world - nose to tail (for cooking with meat) and root to stalk (for cooking with vegetables). &nbsp;It may not be as cool to talk about the random mess of the jars in your pantry, but it is still important to help minimize food waste.</p>
<p>Today I will show you how to take&nbsp;the&nbsp;last few tablespoons of Tahini that stick to the jar and make a great <a title="Instruction Manual: Salad Dressing" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;salad-dressing&#47;">salad dressing<&#47;a>! &nbsp;It is so good, you wont want to wait until your tahini is almost gone!</p>
<p>This recipe&nbsp;only has a few ingredients that&nbsp;you can measure directly into the tahini jar! &nbsp;The most important part to make this dressing successful is to pour in hot water, put on the lid and shake. &nbsp;You may need to open the jar to scrape the bottom or whisk if you had a really big chunk.</p>
<p>Use this dressing on a salad or with whole grains (such as brown rice, barley, or quinoa) or a combination of both in my Tofu Chickpea Grains &amp; Greens&nbsp;bowl.</p>
