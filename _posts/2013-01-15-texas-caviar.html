<p>If you are like me, the first time I heard of Texas Caviar I thought it was a dish with fish eggs in it. &nbsp;That is because I am originally from Washington, down here in the southwest it is a well known dish. &nbsp;It is called Texas Caviar simply because it originated in Texas and the black-eyed peas resemble caviar.</p>
<p>It may seem like a common man's dish, but the creator was a food consultant and cookbook author who directed the food service at Neiman Marcus. &nbsp;It was first served on New Years eve, so it would be a great dish to take to a holiday party (and bonus, you can make it up to a week in advance!).</p>
<p>Texas Caviar is often served by itself or with tortilla chips. &nbsp;I prefer to use a whole grain or blue tortilla chips for their flavor. &nbsp;If you make a whole batch for yourself you might want to think of new ways to use it! &nbsp;Top some salad greens for a simple salad (no dressing required if you have a little leftover dressing at the bottom of the bowl), toast some crostini and top, roll up in a soft tortilla shell. &nbsp;How do you like your Texas Caviar?</p>
