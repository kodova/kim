<p>We all have a go to salad of veggies that are easy to keep in the pantry. &nbsp;It is time to mix it up and start introducing new salads to your repertoire so you never get sick of a healthy lunch. &nbsp;This salad has a simple homemade vinaigrette, I used lime to mix it up from the standard homemade dressings but you could use lemon if that is what you have on hand. &nbsp;It also has a brilliant pesto made with the leaves from your celery stalks. &nbsp;I love the nose to tail movement of cooking with meat, so why not use the same principle and use all parts of your veggies? &nbsp;Both the dressing and pesto can be made in advance so you can prepare over the weekend for a weeknight side or enjoy it for lunch several days in a row without too much work.</p>
<p>This paired beautifully with a glass of ice water with cucumber. &nbsp;Drinking water with a salad was never so easy!</p>
