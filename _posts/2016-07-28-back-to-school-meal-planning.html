<p><&#47;div></p>

When the school year starts most of us fall into two categories. &nbsp;One, a hectic mess that is overwhelmed. &nbsp;Or two, a hectic mess determined to have a better school year than last year. &nbsp;Whether that means the&nbsp;organization of kid&rsquo;s schoolwork, a better morning routine to make are each kid gets out the door with everything that is needed, or determined to send your kids to school with a healthier lunch each day.</p>
<p>That last one seems simple, but it can be a daunting task. &nbsp;I want you to be successful, so here are some tips to help you eat healthier throughout the school year.</p>
<p>First, start simple. You do not want to overwhelm yourself or your kids! &nbsp;If your children are used to eating PB&amp;J with a bag of chips and soda, switch one item at a time. &nbsp;Depending on how picky your kids are it may be changing the bread from white to whole wheat. &nbsp;Or it may be adding lettuce and tomato to a turkey sandwich. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t jump in and send your kids to school with a vegetarian wrap in a gluten-free sprouted tortilla! They might not touch it and be too hungry to focus during class.</p>
<p>Starting with the snack or drink may be an easier place. &nbsp;Give your kids several options of a healthy snack and let them choose which healthy item they want. &nbsp;When they decide which snack they want, have them pack it too. &nbsp;When kids make or simply pack their food gives them more responsibility for their lunch which will make them more likely to eat it once they are at school. &nbsp;Plus, one less thing you have to do!</p>
<p>If your kids are interested in having control over their school lunches, sit down with them and make a list (if they are not, do it yourself!). &nbsp;Depending on how you organize you may want to make a spreadsheet or just have a few different pieces of paper. &nbsp;I would start with a list of snacks - one huge list. &nbsp;Ask for your kids' input, and sometimes it may seem crazy but if it is healthy, write it down! &nbsp;I asked my son, and he said he wanted corn on the cob and pickles on the snack list. Separate the list into categories either into a spreadsheet with multiple columns or color your text. &nbsp;For example, green for vegetables, red for fruit and berries, yellow or brown for carbohydrates, blue for proteins. Try to get some variety from the categories in each lunch.</p>
<p>Make a list of different lunch recipes - tuna salad, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2016&#47;01&#47;curried-egg-salad&#47;">egg salad<&#47;a>, bean burgers, etc.</p>
<p>We all have traditional family recipes. &nbsp;What are yours? Do you have those written down too? &nbsp;If not, do it now. &nbsp;Find your favorite recipes, list them by main protein (chicken, beef, pork, fish, beans) or by cook type &nbsp;(casserole, slow cooker, skillet, grill) or by the length of preparation (20, 30, 45, 1 hour +). &nbsp;When it comes to picking your dinner, you can look at how much time you have or what protein is available in the house (or on sale).</p>
<p>Keep these lists together and when you are ready to go grocery shopping review them all and pick from each. &nbsp;Use a meal planner, like this one, and fill in what you are going to eat when (all while considering special events for the week, like after school sports or meetings). Consider some batch cooking, too. &nbsp;A large portion of brown rice can be used as an everyday side dish, as a rice pilaf, and fried rice. &nbsp;All those options can be eaten for lunch or dinner, they are different enough that you might not get sick of it either! &nbsp;Or consider making a double batch of a recipe over the weekend, so you have leftovers during the week.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to ask your kids what they want! Choices are empowering but don&rsquo;t give them free range.&nbsp; Do you want cucumbers and ranch or cucumbers and hummus? &nbsp;Do you want carrot sticks or rounds?&nbsp; Cheese or Yogurt? If you are working from an unhealthy start like mentioned above, give them choices from their routine. &nbsp;Do you want apple juice and chips or a soda and apple slices?</p>
