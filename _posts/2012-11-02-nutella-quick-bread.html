<p>I love quick breads because, well, they are quick!&nbsp; My first accomplishment after JJ was born was making a quick bread whole he sat in his high chair - at an age where he barely can reach the tray. There are so many different types of quick breads, the most common are banana breads.&nbsp; This one is a banana bread with a swirl of nutella in the middle and paired with a combo of hazelnuts and melted chocolate on top.</p>
<p>Share your favorite combos you use in quick breads or suggest a new combo and I will concoct a recipe for it and post it later!</p>
