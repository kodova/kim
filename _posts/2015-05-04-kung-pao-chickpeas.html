<p>This is a Take-Out, Fake Out that goes beyond your traditional fake-out because this dish is also vegetarian! &nbsp;Only recently have I made an effort to eat meals without meat and at times it is a struggle to feel like I am eating a complete meal. &nbsp;I don't like meat substitutes - not necessarily the flavor or texture, but the concept. &nbsp;If I want to eat turkey, I will eat turkey and not tofurkey. &nbsp;Whatever I am eating, I want the food to show itself and not pretend to be something else.</p>
<p>The chickpeas are tender, savory, and a little nutty - not at all like chicken, but you still don't miss it. &nbsp;This is a great meal to try if you are not used to eating vegetarian dishes because it is a well balanced meal (Whole grains, vegetables, and protein&#47;legumes) which will leave you satisfied. &nbsp;You could also easily substitute in your favorite meat (See tips below for how to substitute meat for part or all of the chickpeas.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;KIM Tips<&#47;h2><br />
Make-Ahead Tip: Make the sauce up to several days in advance, store in an airtight container in the fridge. Cut vegetables and store in a container with a little water to prevent vegetables like carrots and celery from drying out.</p>
<p>Do not stir-fry the chickpeas for too long! &nbsp;They will become gritty and grainy on the inside. &nbsp;So stir-fry until they just start to get some color (doesn't need to be on all sides of the chickpea).</p>
<p>Substitution: You can easily replace all or some of the chickpeas with cubes of cooked chicken or thin slices of cooked beef. &nbsp;If you are serving both a vegetarian and a carnivore, remove half the vegetables and add in a portion of chickpeas and sauce, toss to combine, then remove to serve. &nbsp;Return the other half of the vegetables to the pan, add the meat and toss with remaining sauce.</p>
<p>Make it more restaurant quality: strain the sauce, so it is clean of the ginger and garlic pieces. &nbsp;This will improve the look and texture. &nbsp;Use a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00KXGX5ZS&#47;ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00KXGX5ZS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20&amp;linkId=FEBRFLPYMCHJVQT6">Fine Mesh Strainer<&#47;a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http:&#47;&#47;ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com&#47;e&#47;ir?t=kitchinstrman-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00KXGX5ZS" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" &#47;>&nbsp;for best results.</p>
<p>Use it up challenge: &nbsp;Use the garlic and ginger that you strained from the sauce to create a salad dressing. &nbsp;Mix in oil and vinegar and shake. &nbsp;See my <a title="Instruction Manual: Salad Dressing" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;salad-dressing&#47;">Instruction Manual: Salad Dressing<&#47;a> for an idea on how much and what oil and vinegars to use (as well as many more ideas to help you create salad dressings)</p>
