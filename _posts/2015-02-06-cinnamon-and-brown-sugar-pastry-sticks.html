In my quest for easier homemade breakfasts I thought maybe I would try to make Cinnamon-Brown Sugar pop tarts. &nbsp;I thought &nbsp;I could make a batch over the weekend and&nbsp;have them in the freezer for a quick morning breakfast.</p>
<p>I quickly realized I didn't have the patience to roll and cut pastry dough into perfect thin rectangles. &nbsp;My dough was sticky and no matter how much extra flour or extra chill time I gave it, it still stuck to the counter and the rolling pin or just fell apart when trying to move it. &nbsp;Instead of trying to fix the problem, I decided it would be quicker to change up what I was making.</p>
<p>So I rolled out the dough, brushed with egg wash and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar all over the top. &nbsp;Then cut out into strips.</p>
<p>These taste delicious, more like a dessert than breakfast! Does that make you think twice about handing over a pop tart to your kids when you are in a rush in morning?</p>
<p>Another positive is that these are better for portioning. &nbsp;You can serve one or two on the side of eggs as special breakfast treat. &nbsp;Pop tarts are served two in a bag, which for more kids is way more than they need. &nbsp;But they will eat whatever you give them because most kids LOVE pop tarts. &nbsp;If you make these sticks, you can give them a proper portion.</p>
<p>Forget feeding the kids... Scoop out some ice cream tonight and dig in.</p>
