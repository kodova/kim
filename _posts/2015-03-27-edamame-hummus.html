<p>I am always trying new ways to be healthy. &nbsp;Hummus is one of my staples, and I wanted to change it up... So I switched out the chickpeas for edamame and added some <a title="Instruction Manual: Miso" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2014&#47;12&#47;miso&#47;" target="_blank">miso<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I am declaring that <em>any<&#47;em> version of Hummus is the new Ranch dip. &nbsp;I have made it a priority to change the idea that if you want your kids to eat their veggies you need to serve them with Ranch to serving them with hummus. &nbsp;So far it is working for me! &nbsp;Adding variety to the flavor of hummus allows them (or me!) to not get bored with the dip.</p>
<p>This dip is so quick and easy. &nbsp;You just&nbsp;throw the ingredients in a blender and whirl until smooth! &nbsp; If you are missing either tahini or miso - you can just omit one or the other (not both). &nbsp;You will get a different flavor profile, but still a good dip!</p>
