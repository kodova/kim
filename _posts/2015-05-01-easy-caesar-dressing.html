<p>Eating a side salad with dinner can either be boring or a lot more work than I want to do (especially when I'm already putting a lot of effort into the main part of the meal!). &nbsp;If I don't have a bunch of veggies prepped to mix in with my lettuce, just a plain bowl of greens is not enjoyable. &nbsp;So, if I'm going to eat just lettuce I want a salad dressing with lots of flavor.</p>
<p>A Caesar Salad is one dressing with enough flavor for a bowl of plain lettuce, but&nbsp;I had written off as unhealthy and one that I shouldn't eat... And I haven't for years! &nbsp;I've considered making one from scratch in the past but did not want to buy anchovies or leave them completely out because I knew they add a needed flavor. &nbsp;I recently came across the idea of using fish sauce as a replacement in a recent issue of Cooking Light Magazine. &nbsp;Brilliant! &nbsp;I already use it in other cooking, it is more approachable, affordable, and stays good for longer than anchovies.</p>
<p>One of the biggest ways people make a salad unhealthy is by using too much dressing. &nbsp;Especially with thick and creamy dressing, like most store bought Caesar dressings. &nbsp;A thinner dressing allows you to distribute the dressing better so you aren't consuming hundreds of calories of salad dressing.</p>
<p>Another common mistake with salad dressing is choosing a fat-free or light salad dressing. &nbsp;The idea that fat causes heart disease and obesity has been disproved over the last few years. &nbsp;In fact, fat can help your body absorb more nutrients. &nbsp;So a salad dressing with fat in it will help you absorb the nutrients from the vegetables in the salad.</p>
<h2>KIM Tips<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Use two different oils - although it may be easier&nbsp;to just use one or the other, olive oil has a strong flavor and using too much may make the dressing unappealing and not using it at all may leave the salad dressing flat on flavor.<&#47;li>
<li>Start buying your parmesan in wedges not pre-grated! &nbsp;It will have more flavor and you can whatever texture you need: a fine grate on a microplane, thin shreds from the side of a box grater, or shave by using a vegetable peel.<&#47;li>
<li>Store in a mason jar or other container with a tight fitting lid as the pepper settles to the bottom and you will want to give it a good shake before each use.<&#47;li>
<li>If you miss the creaminess of your store-bought dressing, remove the water for a thicker texture.<&#47;li>
