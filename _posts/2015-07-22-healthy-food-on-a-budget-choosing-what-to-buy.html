<p>As much as I like to cook and experiment in the kitchen, I have been forced to keep a food budget or the money I spend would be out of control! &nbsp;I <a title="Eating Healthy on a Budget &ndash; Food Waste" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;eating-healthy-on-a-budget-food-waste&#47;">previously<&#47;a> discussed the problem with <a title="Eating Healthy on a Budget &ndash; Food Waste" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;eating-healthy-on-a-budget-food-waste&#47;">food waste<&#47;a>. &nbsp;Today I am going to help you choose what foods you should buy.</p>
<p>Start out by keeping&nbsp;a few weeks or a month of grocery receipts and see what your total spent is so you know how much you currently are spending. Then look at the top items on each receipt. &nbsp;<em>What are you spending the most money on?<&#47;em> &nbsp;Is it expensive meat? Frozen dinners? &nbsp;Snacks? &nbsp;Once you identify those, consider how you can reduce those items.</p>
<p><em>Do you snack when you are stressed or bored?<&#47;em> &nbsp;Try chewing gum, drinking a large glass of water, or brushing your teeth instead of snacking.</p>
<p>Consider the junk food you buy as wasted money&hellip; these foods are nutritionally void, it is just to fill your stomach. &nbsp;Instead use that money to buy foods that will provide you with the nutrition your body needs (fruits, vegetables, dairy if acceptable).</p>
<p><em>Do you eat frozen dinners because you didn&rsquo;t have food to cook or more than a few minutes to spend in the kitchen?<&#47;em> &nbsp;Then plan over the weekend and cook in advance - I have a great <a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">Meal Planner<&#47;a> to help with that. &nbsp;Find meals that you can put together quickly from your pantry. &nbsp;Try freezer cooking one day a month. &nbsp;There are a lot of awesome recipes that you put in a ziptop bag, freeze, then put it directly into a slow cooker - Talk about easy!</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to plan your own weekly meals look at some magazines like Cooking Light and Clean Eating - they usually have two weeks of a meal plan in each issue. &nbsp;There are also online&nbsp;services that do it for you like Gathered Table and emeals.</p>
<p><em>Do you spend a lot on meat?<&#47;em> &nbsp;Check your portion sizes - they should be four ounces. &nbsp;So for a family of 4 you would need just one pound for dinner. &nbsp;Chicken breasts are a lot more than 4 ounces!</p>
<p>Have a goal of $ per pound - for me that is about $3. &nbsp;If you have a priority of eating organic, free range, grass fed then that dollar amount will need to be more. &nbsp;So if I want a NY strip steak, I need to counteract that expense with cheap chicken thighs&#47;breasts or pork shoulder. &nbsp;I also started to have meatless meals - using tofu or beans as our main protein source&nbsp;which are significantly cheaper. &nbsp;Tofu is about 1.50&#47;lb and a can of bean is often under $1.</p>
<p>I have also increased the amount of vegetables and grains that I serve with every meal - breakfast and lunch included.</p>
<p>You should take this same approach with vegetables as you do with meat - have a goal per pound&hellip; $1 for conventional or $2 for organic. &nbsp;Anything above that should be treated as a treat if you are on a strict budget, or counteracted with more items that are cheaper.</p>
<p><em>So how do you keep within these goals?<&#47;em></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy in season or with the sales (check the fronts and backs of grocery flyers for the best deals)<&#47;li>
<li>Meal plan around those sales<&#47;li>
<li>Be flexible with your recipes&#47;grocery list: Buy what is on sale - use different types of tomatoes, use different colored bell peppers, different types of greens, different fish, different pieces of chicken, cauliflower instead of broccoli.<&#47;li>
<li>Do not buy more than you plan to eat this week - unless you know how to store it for the long term<&#47;li>
<li>Make your grocery list and stick to it!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<b>Dirty Dozen and Clean 15<&#47;b></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t buy organic figure out how important buying organic is to you. &nbsp;It is a subject that is still highly debated on whether or not organic produce has health benefits. &nbsp;Check out the <a title="Dirty Dozen" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ewg.org&#47;foodnews&#47;dirty_dozen_list.php" target="_blank">dirty dozen list<&#47;a>, pick a few of your favorite foods and start buying those organic. &nbsp;Ease into it.</p>
<p>We have all probably heard about these lists, but can you tell me what foods are on each of them right now? &nbsp;Either when you are making your grocery list, check what items are on these lists and buy accordingly. &nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t make grocery lists, then print out the <a title="Dirty Dozen" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ewg.org&#47;foodnews&#47;dirty_dozen_list.php" target="_blank">Dirty Dozen<&#47;a> and <a title="Clean 15" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ewg.org&#47;foodnews&#47;clean_fifteen_list.php" target="_blank">Clean 15<&#47;a> lists and keep them&nbsp;with you (they also have an <a href="https:&#47;&#47;play.google.com&#47;store&#47;apps&#47;details?id=com.ewg.dirtydozen&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">app<&#47;a>!). &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t spend extra money on sweet potatoes when they are not on the dirty list&hellip; On the other hand, regular potatoes usually are - so know that you may want to buy those organic.</p>
<p>Do your best to try to stick to dirty dozen list. &nbsp;Organic items go on sale too! So if an organic item on the dirty dozen list goes on sale, take advantage of that. &nbsp;Otherwise, fill your shopping cart with items that are on the clean 15 list. &nbsp;There is also a <a title="EWG's Food Scores" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ewg.org&#47;foodscores" target="_blank">rating system<&#47;a> for all foods by the EWG, including packaged foods. &nbsp;It is generally safe to buy non-organic produce if it is not on the dirty dozen list. &nbsp;You can also use a homemade wash to significantly reduce the amount of pesticides on your food.</p>
<p>Also, know what items are not significantly more money to purchase organic. &nbsp;Spinach is one of the cheapest organic foods. &nbsp;You can buy a large container or bag from Costco for just a couple dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fresh vs Frozen<&#47;b></p>
<p>Many items are cheaper if you buy them frozen especially if they are out of season (there are organic frozen options, too). &nbsp;Berries, spinach, artichokes, brussel sprouts, etc. &nbsp;You can also save a lot of money if you freeze your own during the seasonal peaks. &nbsp;Right now berries and stone fruit are cheap. Blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries can be left whole. &nbsp;Stem and half strawberries (or quarter larger ones), and&nbsp;slice stone fruit. &nbsp;Place on a baking sheet, freeze for a few hours, then transfer to a zip top bag. &nbsp;This is great for smoothies or muffins.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;<&#47;strong><&#47;strong></p>
<p><b>Canned veggies<&#47;b></p>
<p>Most Canned vegetables nutritionally are the same or similar to fresh produce. &nbsp;But they add the benefit of being cheap and available in your pantry whenever. &nbsp;You may not have a meal planned, but you could thaw a chicken breast and open a can of vegetables. &nbsp;Need a quick snack, try some canned pears or peaches. &nbsp;Tomatoes are actually one vegetable that is great canned even by professional chefs. &nbsp;I make my own marinara and pizza sauce from canned tomatoes. &nbsp;The large #10 cans you can find at Costco are more than&nbsp;half the price than if you bought the same amount of 28oz cans from a regular store.</p>
<p><strong><strong><br />
<&#47;strong><&#47;strong>Consider canning yourself. &nbsp;Find smaller batch recipes for using the produce that is in season. &nbsp;I have a personal goal of <a title="Produce On Wheels &ndash; Preserving veggies" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;produce-on-wheels&#47;">preserving something<&#47;a> once every other month (sometimes I do a lot at once). &nbsp;Which really is not a big task! &nbsp;I have started making my own <a title="Homemade Pickled Jalape&ntilde;os" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;10&#47;homemade-pickled-jalapenos&#47;">pickled jalape&ntilde;os<&#47;a>, salsa, blueberry syrup (my son&rsquo;s favorite), pepper jelly, sweet &amp; sour pickles, tomato jam, preserved lemons. &nbsp;This helps preserve vegetables when they are cheap, but it also prevents you from buying more expensive specialty items.</p>
<p><strong>Be sure to check for added sugar, salt, or preservatives when you are buying canned items.<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Check back soon for more ideas on how to eat healthy on a budget! &nbsp;And remember, even if you aren't strapped for cash it is a responsible choice to pay attention to the food you are buying.</p>
