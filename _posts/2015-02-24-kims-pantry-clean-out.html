<p>I hardly have any room left in my pantry. &nbsp;I kind of like&nbsp;grocery shopping, I can get obsessive from time to time with coupons, and occasionally impulse buy specialty items. &nbsp;And when the kids are sick it seems like that is the only way I can get out of the house. &nbsp;So, I buy a lot of groceries and occasionally need to step out of the grocery store and into my pantry for our meals.</p>
<p>A couple days ago I sat down and started to write out a pantry and freezer inventory. &nbsp;I wrote down a list of my produce and some dairy and it was the length of my page. &nbsp;I realized that although each item I bought was a good deal, I was just buying way too much. &nbsp;That inspired me somewhat, and I looked at my canned foods and pulled out a can of artichokes that had been in there for a long time. &nbsp;I managed to make two great recipes:&nbsp;<a title="Tuscan-Style Artichoke and Kale Pesto Pasta" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;tuscan-style-artichoke-and-kale-pesto-pasta&#47;">Kale pesto pasta with Artichokes and chicken<&#47;a> and a <a title="Tuscan Pizza" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;tuscan-pizza&#47;">Tuscan-Style Pizza<&#47;a>. &nbsp;This feeling of success has further inspired me to clean out the&nbsp;pantry.</p>
<p>I am challenging myself to use up the stock in my pantry and freezer and minimize my grocery shopping for the next two weeks (or longer!). &nbsp;The biggest challenge will be how to still create healthy, balanced meals so I do not gain a lot of weight! &nbsp;I will still buy things, but keep it minimal. &nbsp;I have decided I will buy salad greens, but no other salad toppings. &nbsp;I can use beans, nuts, and other ingredients I already have. &nbsp;Milk is another important item as I have two toddlers.</p>
<p>I want to share my experience and lessons learned with you. &nbsp;I will post some of my recipes here, but be sure to follow me on <a title="Follow me on Instagram" href="https:&#47;&#47;instagram.com&#47;kims_kitchen_manual&#47;" target="_blank">Instagram<&#47;a> and <a title="Follow me on Twitter" href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;KitchenManual" target="_blank">Twitter<&#47;a> and like my <a title="Like my Facebook Page!" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com&#47;KitchenInstructionManual" target="_blank">Facebook<&#47;a> page for a closer look in my pantry and what I am eating!&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;you can learn from my mistakes and that you join me in this challenge (whether now or in the future). &nbsp;Please share with me your pantry struggles! &nbsp;Do you have any ingredients you don't know how to use up?</p>
