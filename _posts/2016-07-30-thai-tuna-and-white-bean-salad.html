<p>Why is tuna salad so popular?!</p>
<p>I can only assume the&nbsp;simplicity of tuna salad is the main reason anyone makes it. &nbsp;It doesn't have great texture, the flavor is simple, the color is almost disgusting, and although it is called a salad - is&nbsp;really isn't.</p>
<p>What if I told you that there is another option for Tuna Salad that has better texture and flavor but is still simple to make? &nbsp;Oh, and it might be healthier too! &nbsp;This recipe is similar in idea to my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2016&#47;01&#47;curried-egg-salad&#47;">Curried Egg Salad<&#47;a>, they both have bolder flavor and more texture than the original.</p>
<p>This Thai Tuna Salad adds beans for texture and to make it more filling. &nbsp;It has a simple sauce using soy (or tamari) and peanut butter! &nbsp;The flavor is strong enough that if you have kids that don't like tuna it masks some of the flavor. &nbsp;And the cherry tomatoes add great color. &nbsp;You could also use other vegetables instead of tomatoes, like bell peppers or even broccoli. &nbsp;Whatever you enjoy.</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>For the best texture, make sure you drain and rinse your beans!<&#47;li>
<li>If you refrigerate your peanut butter, you may need to heat it up in order to mix the sauce together.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
