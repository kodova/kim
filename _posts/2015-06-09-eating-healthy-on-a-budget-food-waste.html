<p>Everyone has a different reason to want to spend less money on food. &nbsp;For some, you spend more than you make every month (credit card debt). &nbsp;Others, you want to save to buy something special or go on a trip. Most of us need to save for kids college tuition or your own retirement. &nbsp;Others, like myself, also believe&nbsp;it is not responsible to frivolously spend whatever money you want to on food.</p>
<p>Sometimes those reasons are not enough to change spending habits. &nbsp;So I encourage you to find something that makes you passionate about changing your spending habits. &nbsp;Save a certain dollar amount and you get a pedicure (much needed over the summer!), or an extra night out with your significant other with a babysitter to watch the kids. &nbsp;Maybe it is so you can collect some food items that you can donate to a family or community center that is in need. &nbsp;Whatever it is, it needs to be truly motivating for you to make a change.</p>
<p>I recently gave a talk at a <a title="Faith and Food" href="http:&#47;&#47;csfaithandfood.com&#47;about-our-ministry&#47;" target="_blank">Faith and Food<&#47;a> meeting where I talked about a bunch of different ways to eat healthy on a budget. &nbsp;Today I'm going to&nbsp;share a portion of that and discuss&nbsp;Food Waste. &nbsp;I chose this topic to discuss first because for me it was the biggest thing I needed to change. &nbsp;It takes time and effort to make sure you are not wasting anything.</p>
<p>Your first step to saving money on a food budget may&nbsp;not be an immediate money saving tip; it may be a&nbsp;long term process for some.</p>

<h2>Reduce&nbsp;the food you waste<&#47;h2><br />
Almost half of the food in the US is wasted&hellip; that is a lot of money we could be saving as a country. &nbsp;You may not be wasting that much personally, but you also may not realize how much food you are wasting.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;idea is simple: Use all of the food you buy! If you buy two bell pepper for 80 cents each, use one andwaste the second then you essentially paid $1.60 for one pepper.</p>
<p>In order to grasp what food you are wasting, you need to see it. &nbsp;Start to journal. &nbsp;Keep a piece of paper by your trash can or on your fridge and force yourself to write down everything you throw&nbsp;in the trash can or compost. &nbsp;This includes spoiled fruits and vegetables, food scraps (vegetable peels, chicken bones), and leftovers.</p>
<p>Journaling&nbsp;is kind of a psychological trick! Not only will it help you become aware of what your are tossing&nbsp;out, but you will also get to a point where you don&rsquo;t want to write it down. &nbsp;You begin to want to find ways to use your produce or leftovers&nbsp;just so you don't have to write&nbsp;it on the list.</p>
<p>While you are tracking your food waste, make notes of what recipes make too much food for you to eat in one night as well as what recipes call for things like a couple stalks of celery, half an onion, etc. Next time you make that meal cut the recipe down by 25% or be sure to&nbsp;plan another&nbsp;dish that uses those leftover parts later in the week.</p>
<p>I could spend a whole series of posts&nbsp;talking about food waste and how to prevent it. &nbsp;Instead, I will touch on a few items now and then try to incorporate ideas into my posts to prevent food waste with my recipes.</p>
<p><a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;" target="_blank">Meal Plan!<&#47;a>&nbsp; Look at what you currently have in your fridge (write it down on my <a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;" target="_blank">Pantry Inventory list<&#47;a>) and find recipes that will first use the food you already have.</p>
<p>Know how to store your fruits and vegetables so they last longer. &nbsp;Freeze scraps like onion ends, carrot peels, celery trimmings and use them to make stock from leftover chicken bones (did you know&nbsp;you can freeze chicken or beef bones after cooking and eating the meat off them?). &nbsp;Follow me on <a title="KIM on Pinterest" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.pinterest.com&#47;kitchenmanual&#47;" target="_blank">Pinterest<&#47;a>, especially my <a title="Pinterest Cooking and Kitchen Tips" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.pinterest.com&#47;kitchenmanual&#47;cooking-and-kitchen-tips&#47;" target="_blank">Cooking and Kitchen tips<&#47;a>&nbsp;board for creative ideas.</p>
<p>Look into <a title="Root to Stalk Ideas in Pinterest" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.pinterest.com&#47;kitchenmanual&#47;root-to-stalk&#47;" target="_blank">Root to Stalk<&#47;a>&nbsp;(I also have a <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.pinterest.com&#47;kitchenmanual&#47;root-to-stalk&#47;" target="_blank">Pinterest board<&#47;a>&nbsp;for that!)&nbsp;cooking to find out what else you can do with food that istypically wasted like potato peels and carrot tops. &nbsp;It is a growing trend and more and more ideas are coming out regularly. &nbsp;At times by using root to stalk ideas you can get two vegetables from&nbsp;one! &nbsp;So make vegetable chips out of those peelings, use <a title="Apple Whiskey" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;apple-whiskey&#47;" target="_blank">apple peels to make even a cheap whiskey appealing<&#47;a>, and think beyond fruits and vegetables and&nbsp;use <a title="Tortilla Crusted Chicken Nachos" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;06&#47;tortilla-crusted-chicken-nachos&#47;" target="_blank">chip crumbs to make a delicious, family friendly meal<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>When I started to note what my biggest offense with food waste I found that when I was buying 10 pound bags of potatoes for a dollar I was wasting a good portion of that bag. It can be hard to use that many potatoes in a week or two! &nbsp;So I now make french fries or hashbrowns from a portion of the bag to&nbsp;freeze as soon as I can.</p>
<p>This is a continual and seasonal process. &nbsp;Every Spring, Summer, Fall, or Winter I identify different food I'm wasting and I have to research how to use them. Currently I waste a lot of melon rinds such as cantaloupe and watermelon. &nbsp;I'm looking into ways to use those peels a they are edible! &nbsp;I have heard pickling watermelon rinds is great so that is on my list to try -&nbsp;I will share my success or failure soon!</p>
