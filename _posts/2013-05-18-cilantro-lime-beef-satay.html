<p>Grilling season is here! Although in Arizona I can and do grill all year, this is the time of year for new inspiration. I decided to help test Food52's recipes for this past week's contest "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;food52.com&#47;contests&#47;334-your-best-barbecue">Your Best BBQ<&#47;a>" and I chose the cilantro lime beef satay mainly because I had every ingredient on hand and some needed to be used before we went out of town.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend eating this beef on top of either a salad or rice. It has a big punch of flavor from the lime and is a little salty from the soy and fish sauce. I added it to a said the next day and it really helped balance out those flavors.</p>
<p>What is your favorite bbq recipe? Do you have something that you normally make indoors but would like to try on the grill instead?</p>
