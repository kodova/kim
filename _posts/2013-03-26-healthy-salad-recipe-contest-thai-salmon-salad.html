<p>Monti Carlo, a local radio show host, put on this contest for the Arizona Health &amp; Fitness Expo in Phoenix this past weekend. &nbsp;My recipe (below) was chosen as one of the top 5 recipes submitted and I was asked to compete for the grand prize. &nbsp;Monti is an inspiration for me - she is a mom and a home cook who made it to the top 5 of Gordon Ramsey's Master Chef competition. &nbsp;Amazing! &nbsp;Being a new mom is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;an identity change, and cooking has linked my "old" self to my "mom" self. &nbsp;Cooking is a stress reliever, my happy place, and has the end reward of amazing food!</p>
<p>The contest was to create a salad that is healthy and tasty. &nbsp;Although I did not win, my salad was a crowd favorite. &nbsp;There were gasps and yells of "What?!?" when the winner was announced and it was not mine. &nbsp;Even Monti said she agreed with the outcry and that she thought I would have won. &nbsp;Salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, and this salad provides one of the 2-3 recommended portions of fish a week. &nbsp;But you could also use chicken or flank steak as the protein. &nbsp;The dressing does not have any oil in it so the fat content is low. &nbsp;The dressing also has a powerful flavor, so you do not need a lot of it.</p>
<p>For the competition I added a special molecular gastronomy touch to the salad. &nbsp;I took a portion of the salad dressing and added agar-agar to it, dropped it into chilled vegetable oil with a pipette to make "caviar" dressing. &nbsp;It is a salmon salad after all!! &nbsp;The dressing balls allowed the flavor to pop in your mouth, so every few bites of salad you get a little more dressing. &nbsp;I will post instructions with step by step pictures soon so you can try it - it was a simple way to impress!</p>
<p>As a new mom with a husband who is a picky eater, I rarely have time to cook anymore. &nbsp;Most of what I cook from scratch these days is baby purees, but I still enjoy every moment in the kitchen (that isn't doing dishes). &nbsp;I was hoping I could be a "naptime" chef and the big reason for the start of this blog. &nbsp;However, that has yet to work out!! &nbsp;This contest was inspiring, and I hope to post regularly in the future.</p>
