<p>Hey All! I am still <a title="KIM&rsquo;s Pantry Clean Out" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;kims-pantry-clean-out&#47;">cleaning out my pantry<&#47;a>, and it has been fun and interesting. &nbsp;I have not shared a lot of our dishes because its been a lot of leftovers or an array of mismatched foods that I wouldn't normally recommend putting togethe!&nbsp; But I plan to wrap it up soon and share with&nbsp;you know the lessons&nbsp;I have learned about my own pantry and how I should be purchasing and consuming food.</p>
<p>In my freezer I found a "recipe ready" bag that I bought to use for a last minute meal, but found that it contained ingredients I always kept on hand (corn, peppers, onion, and black beans) so I never really found it useful and it has been in the freezer for months. &nbsp;I saut&eacute;ed the vegetables and some chunks of chicken and put it all in leftover pita pockets from my <a title="Breakfast On The Go &ndash; Pita Pocket Greek Omelette" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;breakfast-on-the-go-pita-pocket-greek-omelette&#47;">Pita Pocket&nbsp;Greek Omelettes<&#47;a>. &nbsp;I took the leftovers and made a salad with this chili-lime dressing. &nbsp;It&nbsp;was made with limes I had juiced and frozen in ice cubes as well as a bunch of spices. &nbsp;To learn more about salad dressings see my post "<a title="Instruction Manual: Salad Dressing" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;salad-dressing&#47;">Instruction Manual: Salad Dressing<&#47;a>".</p>
<p>This vinaigrette would also be good with a salad such as my <a title="Southwest Chicken Salad with Avocado Caesar Dressing" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;southwest-chicken-avocado-caesar-salad&#47;">Southwest Chicken Salad<&#47;a> instead of the avocado caesar dressing.</p>
