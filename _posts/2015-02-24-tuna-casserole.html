<p>The reason I chose this recipe as one of the first to start my <a title="KIM&rsquo;s Pantry Clean Out" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;kims-pantry-clean-out&#47;">pantry clean out<&#47;a>&nbsp;is because it is&nbsp;probably the only reason I have cream of celery in my pantry! &nbsp;This was a family favorite when I was growing up. &nbsp;The only&nbsp;change that I had to make was using a regular pasta rather than the egg noodles my mom used.</p>
<p>In addition to using the cream of celery, I had actual celery that I needed to use. &nbsp;Part of taking time out to clear out your pantry is not wasting any ingredients (or leftovers) before they go bad. &nbsp;I still have some fresh vegetables that I purchased before deciding to go on a grocery shopping hiatus, and&nbsp;the celery and bell peppers were going soft. &nbsp;Limp celery is not exactly appealing topped with peanut butter or dipped in hummus, but you never notice&nbsp;when its cooked. &nbsp;When you buy ingredients like celery, plan ahead and know how you want to eat it raw and how you want to eat it cooked. &nbsp;Start with the raw idea, then if you don't eat it all (or didn't have time for the raw recipe) go to the secondary cooked option.</p>
