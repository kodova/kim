<p>I think all of us are constantly looking for ways to have a quick lunch and use up leftovers whether to help the cooking budget or to be sustainable with food. &nbsp;A wrap is a perfect idea for both.</p>
<p>Use leftover&nbsp;rotisserie&nbsp;chicken or whatever chicken dinner you had last night, make a quick 2 or 3 ingredient sauce, add another protein (eggs, bacon, cheese, etc) and some lettuce or other veggies, then wrap it all up in a tortilla or specialty wrap. &nbsp;If you don't have leftover chicken and still want to make this wrap, place one chicken breast in the bottom of a saucepan, cover with water or chicken stock, season with a teaspoon dried herbs (I like thyme), and a dash of Johnny's or Lowry's all purpose seasoning. &nbsp;Bring to a boil and immediately reduce to a simmer for 10 minutes. &nbsp;Check temperature for doneness. &nbsp;If you still need a few more degrees, remove pan from heat and let it sit in the hot water for a couple more minutes.</p>
<p>A couple of tips: to save time and dishes don't measure out your sauce, eyeball and taste; spread your sauce over most of the tortilla, it will help everything stay together; put everything on the wrap cold, then microwave it for about 30 seconds - this will make the tortilla more pliable and it is easier to wrap up.</p>
