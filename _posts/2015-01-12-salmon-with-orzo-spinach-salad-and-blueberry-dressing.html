<p>Don't be intimidated by the long ingredient lists. &nbsp;The spice rub for the salmon has a complex taste, both bright and earthy, but only require one step of mixing and smashing (which is always a good way to get rid of stress!). &nbsp;The dressing you basically through in a blender and let it go. &nbsp;And the salad is simple tossed once you have the veggies cut.</p>
<p>KIM Tip: if you do not have a mortar and pestle to grind the spices with, you can either use a clean coffee grinder or place in a zip top bag, set on a kitchen towel (to dampen noise and keep the bag in place), and pound with a heavy object - rolling pin, meat pounder, or pot.</p>
