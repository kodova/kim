<p>Walnuts and butternut squash pair nicely together in this recipe, however they can easily be substituted. &nbsp;Any winter squash (like acorn or pumpkin) could be a stand-in, while almonds or hazelnuts can replace the walnuts.</p>
<p>This pasta could easily be a side or a meatless main dish. &nbsp;It might seem like a lot of work to cook a butternut squash for a side dish especially since you only need a small portion of the puree. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;cooked squash can stay in the fridge for about 5 days or in the freezer for 6 months and you can use the leftovers&nbsp;for another recipe such as my <a title="Acorn Squash Soup with Sweet Roasted Seeds and Bacon" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2014&#47;10&#47;acorn-squash-soup-with-sweet-roasted-seeds-and-bacon&#47;">Acorn Squash Soup<&#47;a>&nbsp;or even for baby food. &nbsp;And remember, you can store a winter squash for a couple of months! &nbsp;So always keep one on hand.</p>

<h3>Miso<&#47;h3><br />
Check out my <a title="Instruction Manual: Miso" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2014&#47;12&#47;miso&#47;">Instruction Manual: Miso<&#47;a> post if you are not familiar with the ingredient. If you haven't tried miso or are intimidated by the idea of a fermented soybean paste, then this is a good recipe to start with as miso adds a subtle flavor and is easy to work with. &nbsp;If you don't have miso on hand, I'm sure you can omit it. Just taste and add more syrup for sweetness or more salt if the flavors seem dull.</p>
<h3>Walnuts<&#47;h3><br />
Why toasted walnuts? &nbsp;Walnuts are naturally a little bitter when they are raw and toasting them decreases the bitterness and helps bring out the earthiness. &nbsp;You can either put the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet in a 375 degree oven for 5-10 minutes, or on the stove in a dry, hot saute pan and stir frequently until fragrant for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
