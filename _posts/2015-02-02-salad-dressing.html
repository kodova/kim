<p>We often set healthy eating goals that are not sustainable for more than a few days or a week because they are so extreme. A better goal is one that is small and can be worked on a little more each of the 52 weeks in a year. For me that goal is always to cook a little bit more from scratch. Even unhealthy foods are healthier when made from scratch than purchased from the grocery store or a restaurant.</p>
<p>I do home make a lot of dressings, but I also have a tendency to pick up bottles from the store because I get a little lazy.&nbsp;Do you have a shelf in your fridge that looks like mine?</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;DSCN3569.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-676" src="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;DSCN3569-300x225.jpg" alt="DSCN3569" width="300" height="225" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Lets all start making over our pantry by eliminating store-bought salad dressings and replace this shelf with homemade REAL food! Its so much easier to eat that salad a day that you vowed to at the new year when you have an amazing homemade dressing.</p>
<p>Most dressings only require a bowl and whisk, or simply a mason jar to shake (or any container with a tight fitting lid). &nbsp;Sometimes a blender or food processor might be helpful to create a smoother texture or a more even distribution of ingredients.</p>
<p>At the most basic level you can toss a salad with olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, and salt and pepper. Ever wonder why a salad at a restaurant is so much better than what you make at home? &nbsp;Likely - salt, so don't leave it out! &nbsp;When I started adding salt to my salads it changed my world.</p>
<p>The next level is know the basic equation: 2 parts oil, 1 part acid&#47;vinegar, and flavor addition. Use the list below and check your pantry to see what combinations you have available. The list is not all inclusive, but should be helpful in helping you figure out what ingredients make a good salad dressing.</p>
<h3>Oils<&#47;h3><br />
Olive Oil<br />
Sesame Oil<br />
Avocado Oil<br />
Peanut Oil<br />
Walnut Oil<br />
Grapeseed Oil</p>
<h3>Acids<&#47;h3><br />
Wine Vinegars (red, white, champagne, sherrry)<br />

Balsamic Vinegar<br />
Mirin<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;11&#47;instruction-manual-citrus&#47;">Citrus<&#47;a> (lemon, lime, orange)</p>
<h3>Flavor additions<&#47;h3><br />
Herbs<br />
Onion, Shallot, or Garlic<br />
Honey, Agave, Maple Syrup<br />
Chili Sauce (like Sriracha)<br />
GingerSoy Sauce<br />
Tahini<br />
Sesame Seeds<br />
Mustard<br />
Spices</p>
<p>Over time, I will post salad dressing recipes so you can learn flavor combinations or some more complicated dressings (like the cream based ranch which doesn't follow the equation). Bookmark this page so you can check back regularly to find any new recipes.</p>
<h2>KIM Tips<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Taste your dressing before you dress your salad.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Make sure your salad greens are dry! &nbsp;Oil and water don't mix and can make the salad feel heavy.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Tear your greens into bite sized pieces, even the smaller greens like baby spinach or kale.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Put the greens in a very large bowl to dress to prevent spatter and room to use your hands.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Use very little dressing and pour around the outside of the bowl rather than directly on the greens.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Use your hands to toss the salad so you can feel that it is evenly dressed.<&#47;em><&#47;li>
<li><em>Salt your salad!<&#47;em><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
