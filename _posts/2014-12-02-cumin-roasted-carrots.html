Carrots are a great vegetable that is available all year at a reasonable cost. You can eat them raw, steamed, saut&eacute;ed, or roasted. During the fall and winter I crave the deep savoriness from roasted vegetables (and the only time of year in the desert that having the oven on doesn't make the house feel like it is 90+ inside).&nbsp;This technique for roasting can be used for other root vegetables, too.<br />
Carrots and cumin are a great pairing. But carrots are delicious with any of the spices listed below. Start with one seasoning the first time you make roasted carrots and then mix it up (I would use a combination of three or less, otherwise the flavors will muddle and you wont be able to get the great taste of the individual spices). Here I use cumin, which is one of my favorite spices.</p>

The video above is from FoodandWine.com and shows a simply fantastic way to cut carrots. &nbsp;But that is not the only option; you can cut carrots however you want as long as each piece is cut about the same size so they cook evenly. &nbsp;Think about the shape of whatever else you are serving with your meal and add variety with your carrots. &nbsp;Different shapes on your plate is just like color - it creates a more visually appealing meal which will make you more satisfied and possibly help you eat less! If you are serving green beans, then cut them into coins&#47;rounds or slabs (slice the carrots into ovals by angling your knife to the carrot and cutting across like you would for a round cut). If you are serving some round baby potatoes then cut them into stick. To do this evenly, cut the carrot in half lengthwise and in half again crosswise. For the top half which is larger, cut in half lengthwise again (creating quarters).<br />
Also consider who you are serving: kids or adults? &nbsp;Adults, make it beautiful. &nbsp;If you are serving picky kids then cut them into a shape they think is fun. Cut sticks so they resemble french fries. Or if you have a mandolin use the crinkle blade to slice into wavy rounds! After cooking you can cut the carrots further for babies starting to eat finger foods. You can even puree the carrots for baby food, just add some water or stock (omit the salt for the portion of carrots you plan to feed babies).</p>
