<p>If you joined me at Faith and Food in September, you will remember I did a cooking demo of a butternut squash recipe and provided 5 different ways to use the squash. &nbsp;This was one of those recipes, and I'm sharing for all of those who missed the class!</p>
<p>So often when you think about adding vegetables to smoothies, green is the first thing that comes to mind. &nbsp;Sometimes I just want a bright colorful smoothie that has no hint of green color or flavor! &nbsp;This smoothie recipe uses squash as the vegetable rather than spinach. &nbsp;It also has perfect fall flavor, reminding you of pumpkin pie.</p>
<h3>KIM Tips<&#47;h3><br />
<strong>Use your leftovers!<&#47;strong> &nbsp;If you made a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2014&#47;10&#47;acorn-squash-soup-with-sweet-roasted-seeds-and-bacon&#47;">squash soup<&#47;a> or even baby food, use any leftover squash puree for the smoothie.</p>
<p><strong>Cook&nbsp;with your kids!&nbsp;<&#47;strong>This recipe&nbsp;is easy enough for your kids to dump all the ingredients in the blender or just push the button. &nbsp;They will be more likely to try and love it!</p>
<p><strong>Use your slow cooker&nbsp;<&#47;strong>to easily prepare your squash: wrap it in foil, place in empty slow cooker, and cook for about 4 hours (depending on the size of your squash and slow cooker).</p>
