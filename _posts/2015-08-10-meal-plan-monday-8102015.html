<p>What makes me feel motivated at the start of the week is having my week of meals planned (check out my&nbsp;<a title="KIM Meal Planner" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;" target="_blank">free printable!<&#47;a>). &nbsp;I don't always follow it, but it prevents those moments of "I don't know what to cook" and I have more time throughout my week to accomplish other things (like share recipes and tips on my blog and <a title="KIM on Twitter" href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;KitchenManual" target="_blank">twitter<&#47;a>).</p>
<p>Today, I'm going to share what I did last week to help my week go smoothly and not be in the kitchen for hours every day.</p>
<p>Sundays are my day to prepare items that have extensive prep,&nbsp;longer cooking times, or big batches to freeze and&#47;or use throughout the week. &nbsp;This week I made <a title="Omega-3 Pesto" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;omega-3-pesto&#47;">Pesto<&#47;a> (freeze extra), <a title="Roasted Red Pepper Hummus" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;04&#47;roasted-red-pepper-hummus&#47;" target="_blank">Hummus<&#47;a>, Marinara sauce (freeze extra), and double batch of meatballs (freeze half).</p>
<p>Early in the week I made a <a title="One Pan Oven Chicken Parmesan &amp; Zucchini" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;one-pan-oven-chicken-parmesan-zucchini&#47;" target="_blank">One Pan Chicken Parmesan &amp;&nbsp;Zucchini<&#47;a>, which I served with the Marinara sauce I made on Sunday. &nbsp;At the same time I baked a few more items - a time saver and because in Arizona summer is hot and I try to use the oven as little as possible! &nbsp;I baked a spaghetti squash as an additional small side and for later in the week, a few extra Zucchini, and additional chicken (place chicken in a baking dish with chicken stock or water, cover and bake for about 15 minutes until cooked through).</p>
<p>I served&nbsp;the Spaghetti Squash with cooked italian sausage simmered in marinara sauce (I made regular pasta for the kids).</p>
<p>I used the extra zucchini with&nbsp;hummus in <a title="Roasted Zucchini and Hummus Wrap" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;roasted-zucchini-and-hummus-wrap&#47;" target="_blank">this wrap<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>The chicken was used as simple lunches for the kids, as a salad topper, and in this <a title="Pesto Chicken Salad" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;08&#47;pesto-chicken-salad&#47;">pesto chicken salad<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I blended&nbsp;some roasted red peppers (frozen&nbsp;from a <a title="Produce On Wheels &ndash; Preserving veggies" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;produce-on-wheels&#47;">previous big batch cooking day<&#47;a>)&nbsp;with&nbsp;the pesto, spread it with cream cheese on a tortilla, placed on some sliced turkey breast and lettuce and rolled it to make pinwheels.</p>
