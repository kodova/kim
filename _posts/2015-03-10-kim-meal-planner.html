Are you ready to get your meal planning organized?!</p>
<p>While I was doing my <a title="KIM&rsquo;s Pantry Clean Out" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;kims-pantry-clean-out&#47;">Pantry Clean-Out<&#47;a> I knew that I needed to have a better system for doing my meal planning so I was utilizing the ingredients in my pantry while also making recipes that I was excited about.</p>
<p>So many planners that are out there did not seem to fit everything that goes on in my head while I am trying to plan my week. &nbsp;I added a second&nbsp;page that takes meal planning to another organizational level.</p>
<p>To make this even easier, I printed on card stock so I don't need a hard surface to write on and I <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00BUI5QWS&#47;ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BUI5QWS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20&amp;linkId=BEGSSSRHUV5ECVSB">laminated<&#47;a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http:&#47;&#47;ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com&#47;e&#47;ir?t=kitchinstrman-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00BUI5QWS" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" &#47;> the sheets so I can&nbsp;use <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B00006IFGW&#47;ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00006IFGW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kitchinstrman-20&amp;linkId=UL3NIBRSTFMNYZ7T">wet erase markers<&#47;a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http:&#47;&#47;ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com&#47;e&#47;ir?t=kitchinstrman-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00006IFGW" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" &#47;>. &nbsp;I don't have to start over every week and I don't have a lot of items crossed off creating clutter.</p>
<h2>Whats Included?<&#47;h2></p>
<h3>Weekly Menu:<&#47;h3><br />
A section for each day to list your recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as a place for you to write any notes (snacks, make ahead, or even a daily to-do). &nbsp;I only plan for 5 days so if life gets in the way I can shift a recipe to another day. &nbsp;I also like to go out with my family for one meal a week as a kind of family date night.</p>
<h3>Food Inventory:<&#47;h3><br />
A place for you to write out everything you have in your fridge, freezer, and pantry. &nbsp;List it out as you see best fits your thought process. &nbsp;For example fresh fruits &amp; veggies with other pantry items on one side, everything in your freezer on the other side. &nbsp;Read <a title="What Should be in my Pantry?" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;02&#47;what-should-be-in-my-pantry&#47;">What Should be in My Pantry<&#47;a>? for some tips on what you should always have available.</p>
<h3>Grocery Planner:<&#47;h3><br />
On your grocery planner you have a section that lists some basic food categories. &nbsp;If you are not able to write out&nbsp;a full grocery list, make notes of quantity of servings for each categories you have or check which ones you have sufficient amount of and circle the ones you need more. &nbsp;This will prepare you in the grocery store to only purchase items you need. &nbsp;If you need protein, check the meat section and pick what looks good to you or is on sale. &nbsp;Completely skip the sections that you know you already have enough of.</p>
<p>The section below is blank... It is a section for you to add whatever you need. &nbsp;More ideas for meals - such as Meatless Monday, Taco Tuesday, Fish Friday. &nbsp;Or list colors, so you can think about eating healthy and eating from different colors of the rainbow. &nbsp;I sometimes use it as a To-Do list, making note of appointments or tasks I need to do that might interfere with our meals.</p>
<p>List out what coupons, rebates, and what is on sale in your grocery fliers to help you pick which store is the best for you to shop at for the week. &nbsp;It also helps you see what other items you will have available when you are choosing your recipes.</p>
<p>Then you have a spot for your grocery list. &nbsp;Hopefully self explanatory!</p>
<h3>Meal Planning:<&#47;h3><br />
At the top of this sheet is a place for you to list all of your recipe ideas. &nbsp;Throughout your week as you are looking at magazines, pinterest, watching shows and see a recipe you would like to make - write it down! &nbsp;Make note of where you found it and any ingredients you don't already have. &nbsp;If you have everything, then it should be one of the first recipes to go on your menu for the week. &nbsp;Check to see if the ingredients you need are on sale or reasonably priced, if they aren't check again next week.</p>
<p>Your Go-To meals should be meals in your family eats regularly. &nbsp;Review the ingredients for each recipe and keep them on hand as often as possible so whenever you need a recipe to fill in you have options. &nbsp;Try to have a few under 30 minute recipes, and one or two slow cooker recipes. &nbsp;This way no matter what your week throws at you, you are ready.</p>
<p>Throughout your week, list what you have for leftovers and when to use them by (generally 3-5 days). Make sure you plan to eat your leftovers!</p>
