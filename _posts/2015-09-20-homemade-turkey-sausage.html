<p>Clean eating is more than just a trend, it is a lifestyle change that we all need to make. &nbsp;But it needs to be one step at a time so you don't get overwhelmed by changes to the food you eat or cook. &nbsp;One change that you can make that is easier than it may sound is to make your own sausage!</p>
<p>Sausage is a processed meat, nitrates and nitrites are added as a preservative. &nbsp;Once in the body, they can be converted into cancer-causing compounds. &nbsp;In addition, most sausage is made from pork, which more and more health experts are talking about how it is a toxic meat. &nbsp;Then, there is salt. &nbsp;Sausage contains a lot of salt - it is kind of what makes it taste so good! &nbsp;But I think we all know that, especially as Americans, we consume too much salt.</p>
<p>A simple way to solve all those issues&nbsp;is by making your own sausage. &nbsp;You can control the amount of salt added (so if it is a problem for you, you can add less). &nbsp;You can be sure your sausage does not have added chemicals. &nbsp;You can use turkey or chicken rather than pork. &nbsp;And you can adjust the seasoning to be perfect for your tastebuds.</p>
<p>So, is making sausage difficult? No! &nbsp;Take a pack of ground turkey, about 4 spices, and mix together. &nbsp;Thats it.</p>
<p>You can also use ground chicken or even pork if it is organic&#47;grass fed&#47;no hormones added, etc. &nbsp;I try to grind my own meat at much as possible, it is often cheaper and you can make sure there is nothing added (pink slime!) to the ground meat. &nbsp;Simply cut any meat into chunks, freeze meat and grinder parts&nbsp;for about 15 minutes, then put the meat through the grinder according to it's instructions. &nbsp;I use an <a title="KitchenAid Food Grinder attachment on Amazon" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1gAOqaD" target="_blank">attachment for my KitchenAid stand mixer<&#47;a>.&nbsp;I love to use ground chicken in my <a title="Buffalo Chicken Burger with Carrot and Celery Ranch Slaw" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;06&#47;buffalo-chicken-burger-with-carrot-and-celery-ranch-slaw&#47;">Buffalo Chicken Burger<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>KIM Tips</p>
<ul>
<li>I use 20 ounces of ground turkey in this recipe as that seems to be a common amount sold. &nbsp;You can easily adjust the amount of seasoning if you are only making a pound (if you don't want to do the math, just make all of the seasoning and only use about 3&#47;4 of the seasoning).<&#47;li>
<li>Make breakfast sandwiches with this sausage! &nbsp;Portion about 2.5-3 ounces per patty (about 7-8 patties). &nbsp;You can freeze any extras - just simply stack with&nbsp;a piece of parchment between each patty.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
