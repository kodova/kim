<p>As I try to find quick and healthy meals for my family, it sometimes requires using leftovers from a previous meal. &nbsp;Unlike most kids - my son does not like to eat the same thing within the typical timeframe leftovers are good for (even if he loves the dish). &nbsp;So I am either required to eat leftovers by myself while I cook something new for my family or to reinvent the leftovers.</p>
<p>In a previous post, I shared how to make a <a title="Teriyaki Sauce" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;teriyaki-sauce&#47;">Teriyaki sauce<&#47;a> or marinade. &nbsp;I used that for a large portion of salmon, way more than my family would eat at one meal. &nbsp;But I was thinking ahead and thought that I would use the salmon in salads (like my <a title="Healthy Salad Recipe Contest &ndash; Thai Salmon Salad" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2013&#47;03&#47;healthy-salad-recipe-contest-thai-salmon-salad&#47;">Thai Salmon Salad<&#47;a>). &nbsp;Then I got an idea to make a salmon cake out of my leftovers, which sounded better than having a salad!</p>
<p>I used literally all of the leftovers for the previous meal&nbsp;- salmon, rice, broccoli, and teriyaki sauce. &nbsp;And what was great about making a fish cake? My son who barely ate any of the dinner the night before ate the whole cake and liked it! &nbsp;But don't worry, you don't need to have leftovers to make this dish- see the tips below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KIM Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>This recipe could be adjusted for almost any cooked fish, rice, and vegetable combination you have - just keep the proportions the same.<&#47;li>
<li>You can easily use two 6-oz cans or one 13 oz pouch&nbsp;of salmon.<&#47;li>
<li>If you have time, &nbsp;put the patties in the fridge for about 15 minutes to help the patties stay together.<&#47;li>
<li>Really work&#47;massage the mixture together to make a patty that will stick together. &nbsp;If you don't like to touch the mixture you can try to pulse it in a food processor.<&#47;li>
<li>After breading the patties, if they start to fall apart continue to work the patty into a disc and then re-bread it (breadcrumbs act as a binding agent, helping the mixture stay together but can make a fish cake dense if there is too much throughout).<&#47;li>
<li>You could always put this patty on a burger bun! Or between lettuce leaves if you like that ;)<&#47;li>
<li>Start with one tablespoon of the sauce. &nbsp;If your mixture seems dry and crumbly, add up to one more tablespoon (one teaspoon at a time, 3 tsp = 1 tbsp).<&#47;li>
<li>Flip the patties only once! &nbsp;The more your turn them, the more likely it is they will fall apart.<&#47;li>
<li>If you want to serve this as an appetizer, make 12 patties instead of 6.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
