<p>When I made my Apple Pie filling, I wanted a recipe that I could make once and then use in several different ways. This makes efficient use of my my&nbsp;time and&nbsp;ingredients while not eating the exact same thing over and over. &nbsp;When I saw how many apple peels I had left, I didn't want to just toss them in the compost. &nbsp;I spent time peeling the apples, and the skins are a perfectly good part of the fruit.</p>
<p>Flavored spirits are becoming more and more popular. &nbsp;However, our liquor cabinet is full enough and I don't like to stock my pantry with ingredients I will rarely use especially when I can make smaller batches of them. &nbsp;So I decided to make an Apple Whiskey, a flavored spirit that has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>I put the apple skins (can use any variety) in a glass jar&nbsp;with&nbsp;what was leftover of the cinnamon sticks from my apple pie filling, a clove, and covered it with whatever whiskey we had in our cabinet (bourbon would work too!). &nbsp;Left it for a week, and strained it. &nbsp;Use this recipe as a guide for proportions and make as much whiskey as you have apple skins - just make sure that the apples are barely covered. &nbsp;Too many peels and the ones exposed to air may go bad. &nbsp;Too much alcohol and you will not get as much apple flavor.</p>
<p>You can drink this straight, or use in any cocktail calling for apple whiskey, apple bourbon, apple jack, or even calvados. &nbsp;Check back for ideas!</p>
