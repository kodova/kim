<p>Often pancakes require a glass of OJ on the side because even drenched in syrup they leave the mouth feeling a little dry. &nbsp;These pancakes have ricotta cheese to make them moist but not gooey or cheesy. &nbsp;I am not one that enjoys a bowl of ricotta with pepper or fruit, the texture bothers me. &nbsp;But if you didn't know what was in them, you probably wouldn't notice the ricotta. &nbsp;Ricotta also adds nutritious benefits to pancakes; it has a large amount of protein per serving as well as being a good source of vitamins and minerals including calcium.</p>
<p>These pancakes are delicious with just a little butter or maple syrup. &nbsp;But why not mix it up a little and top it with a fruit sauce? &nbsp;It is tasty and a great way to get another serving of fruit in your or your family's diet. &nbsp;You can use either fresh, frozen, or canned fruit for this topping. &nbsp;I chose to use organic apricots packed in 100% fruit juice because that is what I had in my pantry. &nbsp;If using fresh fruit, puree a couple apricots with some water to create a smooth texture.</p>
