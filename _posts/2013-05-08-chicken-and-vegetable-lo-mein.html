<p>If Chinese take-out is regularly on your week's menu plan or your standard back up, consider making this dish at home instead. &nbsp;It is healthier, cheaper, and just a quick if you consider having to drive to pick it up dinner or if you have to wait for the delivery.</p>
<p>Lo Mein is more a method of preparation than a recipe. &nbsp;Start by stir frying some vegetables and meat, add the chinese "flavor trifecta" (ginger, garlic, scallions) and a sauce, then toss in boiled egg noodle made with wheat. &nbsp;It is a perfect way to get a variety of vegetables in your dinner. &nbsp;My recipe calls for a lot more vegetables than your typical take-out lo mein which usually only has bok choy, cabbage, and&#47;or carrots. &nbsp;At home you can try to get all the colors of the rainbow in the dish, or you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand. &nbsp;If you don't have a lot of time, you could buy pre sliced vegetables at your grocer (most sell at least a "fajita" pack).</p>
