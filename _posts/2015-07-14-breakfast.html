<p>Breakfast has been said to be the most important meal of the day. First, when you start with a healthy meal you are more likely to continue to eat healthy throughout the day. It also may help you lose weight by increasing your metabolism (increases the calories your body burns) and prevent you from eating too much (helps reduce the total number of calories you consume throughout the day).</p>
<p>Breakfast isn&rsquo;t just important for our physical healthy, but our mental&#47;emotional health as well. Studies have show children who eat a healthy breakfast have a more stable mood throughout the day. Sugary breakfasts create a mental crash (<em>even just 30 minutes later!<&#47;em>) that young children can&rsquo;t handle. They become agitated, aggressive, and have anxiety. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but when I have happy kids in the morning the rest of my day is better and I feel in control. &nbsp;Even adults struggle with sugar additions without realizing it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately breakfast tends to be one of the most simple meals of the day whether you cook or not. &nbsp;This may be because so many of us are overly tired or in a hurry. I&rsquo;m making a goal to improve my breakfast. To start, I wanted to identify the current things we do for breakfast and figure out how to improve. Here are some ways we eat breakfast:</p>
<h3>Drinks<&#47;h3><br />
Smoothies and juices are great liquid nourishment for mornings on the go, for those who aren't hungry when they wake up, or for families who don&rsquo;t eat at the same time. I like that I can drink it hands free through a straw on mornings that I am busy doing other things like prepping meat for dinner or have a grumpy child on my hip.</p>
<p>It is also a great way to get in several servings of fruits and vegetables. So, if the rest of your day is not ideal then at least you started the day with lots of fruits and veggies!</p>
<p>There are too many juice and smoothie recipes for me to pick as the best. Take what ingredients you like or have on hand and search for a recipe. Or create your own smoothie recipe by following this guide:</p>
<p><strong>1 cup berries&#47;fruit, 1&#47;2 banana, 1&#47;2-1 cup greens, and 2 tbsp of add-ins like chia, flax, peanut butter, protein powder.<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>Make ahead tip:<&#47;strong> Make several smoothies and freeze the ingredients whole in individual bags.</p>
<p><strong>To serve:<&#47;strong> add 1 cup milk of your choice (whole, coconut, almond, etc) and 1&#47;4 water (if needed for consistency) to blender, then add contents of bag. Blend until smooth.</p>
<p>In addition a glass of lemon water or water with a splash apple cider vinegar are a great way to keep your body healthy.</p>
<h3>Make Ahead<&#47;h3><br />
There are also some great make ahead options that you can freeze like breakfast burritos or a casserole. Overnight oatmeals in the fridge or crock pot, granola bars, and muffins are also meals that can be prepared the night before or several days in advance.</p>

<p>Sausage and Hashbrown Breakfast Casserole (check back soon!)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the point in using a slow cooker for most breakfast items. Most items you can&rsquo;t cook&nbsp;overnight since the cooking time is shorter than your average night of sleep or the &ldquo;warm&rdquo; feature compromises the recipe. Often&nbsp;the oven or stovetop is quicker - you probably don&rsquo;t want to wait 5 hours from when you wake up to eat breakfast. That being said the slow cooker always has its place! &nbsp;I'll add a few recipes soon!</p>
<h3>Top It<&#47;h3><br />
You can get creative with toppings for toast, waffles, and oatmeal.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;cinnamon_cranberry_granola2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1120" src="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;05&#47;cinnamon_cranberry_granola2-683x1024.jpg" alt="Cinnamon Cranberry Granola" width="400" height="599" &#47;><&#47;a></p>

You can make one large batch and use over several weeks.</p>

<p>Review the lists for combination ideas. Keep in mind what items you regularly have as leftovers but you might not think of having for breakfast (chickpeas, celery, marinara sauce). &nbsp;Go back and review the lists every few months to see what fits into your seasonal cooking.</p>
<h3>Quick &amp; Easy<&#47;h3><br />
I like hot breakfasts, but sometimes we don't plan&nbsp;ahead. For this reason I love to have some quick and easy breakfast ideas. I always have my pancake mix on hand (stop buying it in the box! You probably have everything you need in your pantry and you won&rsquo;t pay for unwanted added ingredients!

<p>I buy a large amount of sausage from a warehouse and form into patties and store them in the freezer (or when pork shoulder is a deal then I make it myself). I then use <a title="Silicone Egg Rings" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1HZJvLk" target="_blank">egg rings<&#47;a> and make sausage egg sandwiches whenever! &nbsp;For the little kiddos I give it to them deconstructed and cut up when necessary.</p>
