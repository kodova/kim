<p>This was my Thanksgiving Day cocktail but it is perfectly seasonal for any of your holiday parties. &nbsp;Cranberries are common at your Thanksgiving dinner table, red is the color of Christmas, and a bubbly apple cider is something you can ring in the New Year with (especially if you don't like Champagne!).</p>
<p>What is great about this drink is that it is equally great with or without the alcohol (ginger beer is non-alcoholic). &nbsp;So if you are afraid of feeling out of place not drinking, don't want the extra calories that comes with drinking (and the following binge eating), or if you want to have something enjoyable to drink between alcoholic beverages, this is the perfect mocktail!</p>
<p><strong>KIM Tip<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Use frozen cranberries as a garnish and as "ice" to keep your beverage cold without&nbsp;getting watered down!</p>
