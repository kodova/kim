<p>Do you enjoy cooking squash? &nbsp;The difficulty of cutting it in half or the heat of the oven for nearly an hour.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn't think so!</p>
<p>What if I told you there was a way that you didn't have to cut the squash or deal with the heat? &nbsp;It is true! &nbsp;You can throw a whole squash in your slow cooker and let it go, untouched for a couple hours. &nbsp;Then you have a perfectly&nbsp;cooked spaghetti squash with strands that unravel easily and are tender but cooked through.</p>

<ul>
<li>This method works for butternut squash as well!<&#47;li>
<li>Your cook times&nbsp;may vary depending on the size of your squash<&#47;li>
<li>If you are batch cooking or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;03&#47;kim-meal-planner&#47;">meal planning<&#47;a> this is a perfect item to be cooking while you are preparing other meals.<&#47;li><br />
