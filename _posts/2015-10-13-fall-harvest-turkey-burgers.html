<p>Burgers are not typically seen as "Seasonal" cooking. &nbsp;Bread, meat, and condiments are available all year. &nbsp;But why not add ingredients to your burger that are seasonal?</p>
<p>This burger does not appear to be different than your ordinary burger, but it has grated apple mixed through the patty. &nbsp;Not pictured is caramelized onions which are a staple this time&nbsp;as it is a lengthy&nbsp;process perfect for cooking on long cold days.</p>
<p>If you fear dry turkey burgers, try to find a blend (or grind one yourself!) that uses both white and dark meat. &nbsp;If you can't find a blend with dark meat don't worry, the addition of apples to the mixture not only adds flavor but also moisture.</p>
<p>Think you will miss your red meat? I use a steak or grill seasoning to add the savoriness you are looking for.</p>

<h2>KIM Tips<&#47;h2></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want caramelized onions but don't want to hang in the kitchen for an hour while they cook, simply make them in your slow cooker or crock pot.<&#47;li>
<li>If you are grating the apple by hand on a cheese grater, I would suggest peeling the apple first to make it easier to grate. &nbsp;If you are using a food processor, leave the skin on (more fiber and flavor) but check for large pieces of skin.<&#47;li>
<li>Depending on the size of your buns or how large you like your patties, you may want to make 4 for larger buns or thicker patties, or 6 for smaller buns or thin patties.<&#47;li>
<li>Mix the ground meat as little as possible for the best texture.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
