<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At times over the summer (and spring here in AZ) you&nbsp;can get corn for really cheap - I just got 5 ears for $1. &nbsp;Although you can change up the seasoning you use for traditional corn on the cob, occasionally you need to switch it up. &nbsp;So I grilled up some of the corn, made <a title="Corn Stock" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;04&#47;corn-stock&#47;">corn stock<&#47;a> with my husks and cobs, and put them together in a soup!</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of corn chowders with bacon, and as much as I love bacon, I felt like chorizo would add amazing spice without a lot of added ingredients or measuring. &nbsp;The texture of chorizo I also felt would be better in soup - I don't like chewy, soggy bacon.</p>
<p>Depending on the chorizo you choose, this soup can be a little spicy. &nbsp;The chorizo I chose ended up being a little too spicy for my little ones. &nbsp;If it is a little spicy for you,&nbsp;a tablespoon of&nbsp;sour cream or a small handful of cheese helps. &nbsp;And for adult - it pairs perfectly with a cold beer!</p>
<p>KIM Tip: &nbsp;You can use fresh or frozen corn for this recipe. &nbsp;If using frozen, take 1 1&#47;2 cups thawed corn and "roast" them over a hot saute pan until you get a deep brown color on most of the kernels.</p>
