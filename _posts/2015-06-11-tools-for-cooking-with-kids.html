<p>From the moment I found out I was pregnant, I knew that I wanted my kids to help me out in the kitchen. &nbsp;I love to cook and believe it is an important skill for everyone to know. &nbsp;I don't have to encourage or find things for my son to help with - He frequently asks to help, or if he is crabby while I'm trying to make dinner or lunch I ask him to help me and he's all in.</p>
<p>Yesterday he cut up watermelon into tiny&nbsp;quarter inch chunks, just for fun. &nbsp;It was supposed to be his snack but by the time he was done he didn't care about a snack anymore! &nbsp;Today he helped me make a light version of Fettuccine Alfredo with Spinach and Tomatoes (similar to&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.acouplecooks.com&#47;2014&#47;03&#47;fettucine-alfredo-spinach&#47;">this recipe<&#47;a>). &nbsp;He helped me grate cheese, stem and cut spinach, cut tomatoes, and mix it all together in the pot. &nbsp;The only thing he didn't help with was anything to do with boiling water.</p>
<p>There are lots of suggestions of what kids can do at certain ages. &nbsp;I want to encourage you to ignore those lists. &nbsp;You know your child and know what they are capable of. &nbsp;My son started using a knife just after he turned two (a special knife of course!). &nbsp;But he always liked toys that were about&nbsp;fine motor skills so he had the capability.</p>
<p>So get your kids away from their toy kitchens and in your kitchen with real food. &nbsp;Eventually, you might even get to take a night off from cooking! &nbsp;If that doesn't seem like it could be soon, at least consider that if you involve your kids in cooking dinner then they wont be constantly asking for a snack or when dinner will be ready!</p>
<p>Here are some tools and skills that you should have your kids start with (note, the links are affiliate, but they are for products I have or something close to it!):</p>
<p><a title="Blendtec Blender" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1cHNaka" target="_blank">Blender<&#47;a>: &nbsp;Great for many ages. &nbsp;Youngest can push the button (just warn them about the loud noise first!). &nbsp;Next step,&nbsp;they can dump measured ingredients in. &nbsp;After that, give them prepared fruits and vegetables, let them&nbsp;choose their own combination for smoothies.</p>
<p><a title="Grill Skewers" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1AZ4FrO" target="_blank">Skewers<&#47;a>: Let kids add cut fruits and vegetables to the skewer. &nbsp;They can eat them raw or grilled. &nbsp;You can teach food safety to older kids and let them skewer chicken, beef, or even shrimp. &nbsp;The ones suggested here are awesome because the food doesn't twist and turn. &nbsp;If you have standard skewers you can even let your kids practice with cheerios!</p>
<p><a title="Curious Chef 3-Piece Nylon Knife Set" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1G8UlfK" target="_blank">Kids chefs knife<&#47;a>: This is a 3 piece set that grows with your kids. &nbsp;I still have my son using the smallest. &nbsp;They are great for cutting bananas, melons, strawberries, tomatoes, grapes (for more skilled hands!). &nbsp;Start simple and keep adding. &nbsp;If you want to teach your kids to cut even pieces then get them&nbsp;a <a title="Obsessive Chef Cutting Board" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1IrrRi6" target="_blank">cutting board with measurements<&#47;a> on it.</p>
<p><a title="Spray bottle" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1G8W6tk" target="_blank">Spray bottle<&#47;a> - fill a bottle with <a title="Instruction Manual &ndash; Cleaning Produce" href="http:&#47;&#47;kitcheninstructionmanual.com&#47;2015&#47;07&#47;instruction-manual-cleaning-produce&#47;">my&nbsp;produce wash<&#47;a>&nbsp;to spray down and clean fruits and vegetables. &nbsp;Any spray bottle will work, but keep them small so they are not too heavy when full or hard to maneuver.</p>
<p><a title="Scrub Brush" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1S0q7Rj" target="_blank">Scrub brush<&#47;a>&nbsp;- To help clean produce (or even their toys!)</p>
<p>Measuring Cups - You don't need to buy new ones but a lot of cooking with kids is having mise en place (have everything cut and portioned and ready to use)&nbsp;and&nbsp;you are doing double duty and trying to teach math skills like fractions of cups you may want to have an additional set. I like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1S36RCY" target="_blank">this set because it is colorful<&#47;a> - so you can teach colors and sizes rather than fractions. &nbsp;If you have liquid measuring cups that are glass, buy <a title="Plastic Liquid Measuring Cups" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1S36uZ1" target="_blank">plastic measuring cups<&#47;a>&nbsp;so they don't break.</p>
<p><a title="Pastry Brush" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1HpfLHN" target="_blank">Pastry Brush<&#47;a> - These are great for kids to play with! &nbsp;The silicone option means they can put them in their mouth and not get stray pieces down their throats! &nbsp;For cooking, a pastry brush is helpful to brush and egg wash or water on different pastries or pastas like ravioli or pirogies. You can even have them brush BBQ or other thick sauce on grilled chicken.</p>
<p><a title="Cheese Grater" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1F9FFJt" target="_blank">Cheese Grater<&#47;a> - Kids can shred cheese, potatoes, or other vegetables on the grater. &nbsp;Help them at first until they know how to position their fingers.</p>
<p>If you need a little extra encouragement to get your kids excited about cooking you can get them a whole <a title="Cooking tools for kids" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1f51HrH" target="_blank">set of kitchen tools<&#47;a> that are just for them. &nbsp;Whenever a kid gets something new or takes ownership in something they are more interested in it. &nbsp;You can also get a kids chef outfit (available in <a title="Kids chef apron and hat" href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1S7H4JN" target="_blank">pink, yellow<&#47;a>, and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;amzn.to&#47;1B5sBKn" target="_blank">blue<&#47;a>) if they like to dress up!</p>
