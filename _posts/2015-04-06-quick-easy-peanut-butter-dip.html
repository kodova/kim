<p>A standard healthy snack is apples and a couple tablespoons of peanut butter. &nbsp;Delicious. &nbsp;The problem? &nbsp;That it is recommended to eat a <em>couple tablespoons<&#47;em>. &nbsp;I want to eat a tablespoon on each slice!</p>
<p>The solution? &nbsp;Mix in greek yogurt!! It still tastes like peanut butter, it has&nbsp;a creamier texture, and less goes further. &nbsp;You get also get the added health benefits of the yogurt and less fat and calories than if you were having just PB.</p>
<p>Great idea, but you are too busy and don't have time to make a dip - right? &nbsp;Think again. &nbsp;This dip is only two ingredients! &nbsp;And you can buy the individual size portions of greek yogurt so you have one less item to measure and one less measuring cup&nbsp;to clean.</p>
<p>Use whatever kind of peanut butter is your favorite - chunky or smooth. &nbsp;You can even add crushed nuts to the top. &nbsp;Just be sure to choose a healthy peanut butter. &nbsp;Watch out for added sugars and hydrogenated oils. &nbsp;Ideally "Roasted Peanuts" should be the only thing on the ingredient list on the nutrition label.</p>
<p>Same thing with yogurt. &nbsp;Look for options that are only pasteurized milk and live active yogurt cultures. &nbsp;Fat is OK! &nbsp;Reduced fat options often have added sugars to make up for flavor.</p>
<p>For and idea of what to look for on your nutrition lables, my friends (and personal healthy eating inspiration) at <a title="Little Choices Matter" href="http:&#47;&#47;littlechoicesmatter.com&#47;" target="_blank">Little Choices Matter<&#47;a> have brief posts on the nutrition labels of <a title="LCM: Choose Wisely - Greek Yogurt" href="http:&#47;&#47;littlechoicesmatter.com&#47;2011&#47;04&#47;01&#47;choose-wisely-greek-yogurt&#47;" target="_blank">Greek Yogurt<&#47;a> and <a title="LCM: Choose Wisely - Peanut Butter" href="http:&#47;&#47;littlechoicesmatter.com&#47;2011&#47;04&#47;20&#47;choose-wisely-peanut-butter&#47;" target="_blank">Peanut Butter<&#47;a>.</p>
